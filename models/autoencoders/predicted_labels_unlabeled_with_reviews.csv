CG,NOTE:
OR,Very bad experience with this iPhone xr phone. Back camera found defective and non functional. Amazon is very careless. I haven't got any response on confirmation for replacing. I am just hanging with a damaged piece worth of more than 91000 rupees.
CG,Amazing phone with amazing camera coming from iPhone 7 plus great service from amazon
OR,"So I got the iPhone XR just today. The product looks amazing. But unfortunately the Face ID is not working and there’s a glitch in the front camera’s portrait mode. That’s fine, it may happen. But what’s not fine is the pathetic service provided by amazon and apple. Firstly, amazon takes no responsibility of the product once sold. Talking about the giant, apple, the so called market leaders. Went to the service centre, after running a diagnostic the solution they came up with is sending the phone to Bangalore for repair. Like sending the new phone for repair is the practical solution that the company provides after charging a bomb for the product. And also to mention, amazon.in is not an authorised apple reseller. I guess this issue will be escalated to the consumer court. Thank you amazon and apple!"
OR,"I've been an android user all my life until I decided to try iPhone XR for iOS. Loving the camera and battery life is an absolute joy to have. It's been more than one month since I got this phone and I'm loving it. Face ID works flawlessly even in the dark and the dual sim function is working like a charm, I'm using Vodafone as my primary sim and Jio as e-sim and have faced no problem whatsoever."
OR,I was delivered a phone that did not work immediately after removing from the box. I was not able to return it as I need to first check with Apple. Apple service told me that the phone was lying without charge since 5 months and hence the battery failed. Now I have had to leave the phone with Apple for repairs and waiting for them to replace the battery. Please answer this: WHY SHOULD I RUN AROUND FOR THE SUB PAR QUALITY DEVICE WHEN I WAS SHIPPED A DEAD PHONE? Last time I ever purchase a phone online
OR,"It has been a month since I started using my iPhone XR and the experience has been awesome. Excellent battery life, smooth operating system, and most of all, dual Sim functionality are the best features of this iPhone. Spent so many days to decide on the colour, but opted for white, and I’m very happy about it. Coral is also a very good colour option which I have bought for my wife. Only issue bothering me is the time taken to charge the phone. You need to opt for overnight charging. Other than that, extremely happy with the purchase."
OR,The phone is hanging. Video quality is not very good.
CG,I'll use this review to mostly say what I'm not a fan of in this particular iPhone model.
OR,Went with the iPhone XR after over a month of consideration.Amazon was offering some really good discounts and felt the time was right to upgrade having used the iPhone 6 for four seamless years.

CG,Best mobile  and my favourite Where nice XR Amazing futures and best camera so thanks for  Amazon
OR,"Don't buy Apple products from Amazon. I got a defective product which is not activating. During first charging the iPhone started heating like anything. Since there was a 10 days replacement policy, so I asked Amazon to replace it as the product is defective. But very poor customer service from Amazon. They didn't change the iPhone rather told me to visit service centre. Now I am with a defective product which is not operating."
CG,Face recognition is slower some times. I have no complaints about it. I am die hard fan of XR. I was eagerly waiting for dual sim iPhone. It’s heavy but looks are so attractive that you will be ready to carry that little extra weight. I am using it since two months. Don’t watch any reviews. Just buy it and enjoy. Yes it’s expensive. Sometimes rather many times money is not worth than happiness.
CG,"Great Phone, I am happy with the phone so far."
CG,"There are lots of reviews on net for XR, I would give just quick points based on my experience of XR 128 GB."
CG,Don’t buy this phone only waste of money it hang’s many time.
CG,STEVE JOBS GONE i phone gone !!!!!!
CG,Single SIM is working fine but if you are using E-sim in this phone. Not good quality for dual sim. Many times Number showing switched off.
CG,It is not supporting any type of sim.. the network gets disconnected after sometime only
OR,"i always was unhappy with the size of my previous iPhones (iPhone 7 and 5s), I badly needed an upgrade and but don’t have the budget of 1lakh so I took my chances with XR and I am very happy with my purchase."
OR,This is a product which lets down the whole high end feel of an iPhone. Apple has packed in a very sophisticated software hardware system in a rather disappointing design and the phone is bulkier and heavier than any of its competition in the market. The premium feel of the product is completely let down and left to enjoy is a good software interface of ios and an excellent camera. Overall a cheap buy for an apple lover but for a first time user the phone is totally let down.
OR,Im facing some speaker related issues and had given my handset XR 64 Gb in service center they denied to repair the same stating that the handset is fake and not valid for any warrenty
OR,All in all an amazing product yet again from Apple. I know many people are confused wheather to go for an apple X or Xr. Well to be frank i suggest XR purely because of the fact that XR will have 1yr more support from Apple in respect to X.  Other than that the dual camera of X and single camera of XR have the same quality. As far as speed goes both are same. Xr is dual sim but you gotta understand you can insert just 1 sim. The 2nd sim is an eSim which needs to be activated by Telecom service providers. Theres not much difference in display as well. All in all XR rules
OR,I had taken the phone but the phones holds too many defects and issues. When we talk the mouth pice is not that precise to hold you voice creaky the voice is not audible if the phone is even partially away from your chin/mouth.
CG,there are two angles from which smartphones are generally looked. and i will be very honest in this review so that a genuine user can understand if he really wants apple!
CG,"Smooth as butter, no lag and awesome display with superb camera..Just the perfect phone"
OR,"Using around a week now. It’s snappy fast. Power efficient. Gives a back up of a whole day on average use. It has a single but impressive rear camera. Selfie camera is excellent. Low light performance is average though. The phone is bulky, Heavy, weighing more than 190 grams. You surely need to use a protective case to protect Camera bump and glass on both sides. Display is crisp."
CG,This is by far the best smartphone i have ever owned.
CG,"A Perfect Phone with a great camera, great performance, Great look, Great Battery life and a good Display. Worth the trade off. Perfect size"
OR,"NEVER BUY it from Amazon. VERY POOR PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER CARE.i bought it and received it on 3.10.2019 and noted a crack on right top corner of display which was visible when the plastic sticker was removed and complained to amazon customer cell on 4.10.2019. they assured a replacement. nothing happened. when i called them a number of times, they simply tranfer my calls to diiferent sections and then assurinng call back and then not calling back. Apple says it is the duty of amazon to take measures for replacement. Still left nowhere with my money gone on a damaged product."
CG,Extremely easy to use. Good specifications.
OR,Best iPhone I’ve used. Sold my one plus 6 and got this one. The screen is not an OLED so you miss out on deep blacks and saturation. But I noticed the colours are better than the older iPhones with LCD. It also has thick bezels which take some time to get used to. An OLED screen on this would’ve been wonderful but apple being apple wont do that!
CG,Poor Front camera cannot take photo with light at background (photo attached)
CG,"This is my first phone from Apple. I was in confusion in buying between pixel and iphone. Even though pixel is far superior than apple in all departments, I went for iphone due to craziness. The product is well packed and delivered. When I started using the phone, the screen looks average, battery is good and the hardware seems good. The camera disappoints me al lot. Never expect this from Apple. In particular, the front camera is worst, in indoor lightning conditions and can see dots in image like a VGA camera.  At a cost of 60k, I was more so curious about the camera. It disappoints me badly. Even my motorola camera works well. If you are crazzy for the brand, go for it. Else definitely, you can go for other models in the market."
OR,This Appario seem to be a fraud. My shipment has been smartly tampered and the have managed to overcome the security features. Even iPhone package back label have been tampered. Amazon Customer Care on phone or Twitter is of no help. I need to return this and get a replacement.
CG,"Most Beautiful, Fast and Stylish iPhone, I've ever Had.."
OR,"Like every time, Apple has again mesmerised me with it’s great creation iPhone XR. The best part in this is when you unbox your brand new iPhone. It comes with an earpod, and a Fast charger. I understand that the price might be a bit high but trust me, it’s worth it. The camera has the best feature within it. Everyone says that it’s an LCD screen but you’ll nit be able to differentiate just by looking at the screen. The phone performance  is more faster now. And last but not the least, I am really impressed with the battery back up time. It really lasts. Full charge at 10 am and then the whole day on Cellular Data, I have played PES2019, played some songs from YouTube Music, hovering on Whatsapp, Instagram, Facebook and clicked some good photos. When i came back home at 11 o’clock, i still had 66% charge. That’s what we needed in an iPhone."
OR,iPhone XR is excellent there is no doubt about this. This first time my iPhone experience. Its great experience. But I am very unhappy about the dual sim performance (May be solved the problem).
OR,Been a iPhone user always. Upgraded to iPhone XR from iPhone 6 and I have no regrets. Just love the ease that face recognition brings in... freedom that 128GB memory brings in... and of course peace of mind that Apple brand name brings in.
CG,the phone wont turn on
OR,"A lot of criticism of iPhone XR has been about its inability to take portrait pics of “only human faces!” Though true, it can be very easily overcome by downloading a software app - “Halide!” That and the near negligible difference in viewing experience, puts it on par with iPhone XS and even XS Max! Just go for it— the 256 GB storage version!"
CG,Prices have fallen by rs 10000 in 3 days after I bought my phone. I feel terrible.
OR,Faulty product delivered and Amazon not giving replacement. Cheating with customer and just making money by scam and defective product delivery. Phone is not usable as display stop working randomly and screen freeze suddenly. I have provide problem video also to Amazon within 10 days of replacement but Amazon just making money and cheating with customer.
OR, Iphone is good but probably I have received a defective piece from amazon as I am facing issues with software. Further never heard a iphone to be hanging issue but I am facing the same and attached a video regarding it. Within a month I have to visit customer care and still facing issues. Very worst experience don’t buy it from amazon.
CG,"Super fast performance, long battery hours, little heavier than iphone 7 plus. Overall good phone."
OR,Has many drawbacks. Apps developed for iPhone by Indian Companies aren’t good at all. You can’t even do a normal Tatkal booking as irctc app unavailable. No dual Whatsapp so one number is wasted. No dual Facebook as well. Maximum 5gb cloud backup storage limit. Apps get refreshed more frequently and better enhancements on android. No features to search apps easily. Wifi once disconnected loses auto join features. Maximum 100 call records that’s very very annoying. Difficult to set primary and secondary sims in sms. Some Whatsapp features missing.
CG,It is heavy weight if u use more ull feel it hard to hold on regular note!
OR,"There have been multiple issues faced since started installing and restoring from icloud. Gets hanged/stuck, suddenly WiFi gets disconnected and doesn't get connected till restart, deteriorated network speed on usage of the data....."
OR,"First off, the battery life is INCREDIBLE! This is the first phone I have used where I can get two days of use on one charge! I would regularly charge the phone overnight one night, then go to bed at midnight with 55-60% left the next night, leave it unplugged, and finish the next day at midnight with around 2-5%. The size of the phone was just just about perfect for holding/scrolling with one hand, and I usually wear men’s size medium gloves for reference."
CG,"When compared with XS only visible difference would be screen, that too when kept side by side."
CG,"Awesome IPhone.. I have upgraded from iPhone 6 and I can notice the significant different in display, touch and XR is certainly faster. It’s worth the upgrade..! Thank you Amazon for delivering it securely."
OR,"Got this phone for offer price. Everything is great from packing to delivery. Display quality is very good. Dual sim option is very good, got esim from airtel"
OR,Bought this phone for my wife. She's absolutely happy with the phone.
OR,I want to replace this iphone because since i got this it worked well for w week then later on its speed is slowed down and even it hangs sometimes. Its been 3 months since i got this n i m already irritated with this device. My lighting usb has already stopped working .
CG,Great phone for better photos and low light battery usage is much better than X
OR,"So overall it’s a pretty nice phone, I honestly don’t find much difference in features from my old iPhone 6. Apart from face recognition."
CG,Good phone
OR,"I’ve been using Android for close to a decade and now decided to check out iOS. Thanks to Amazon Prime Sale, got iPhone XR for a discounted price(Still expensive), Coming to the iPhone itself, after using phone for 3 days, below are the points I came across."
CG,Using this phone since 2 months. Here is my review. Hope you will find it useful.
OR,"I was skeptical looking at some XR reviews and also purchasing an iPhone off Amazon (previously always bought through Apple Stores). However, so far happy with what I have. The delivery was fast (on Prime, next day); all original packing (phone box) and phone is working fine. Touchwood - no issues. The Deal was good with the 10% additional HDFC discount. Go for 128 GB (or even higher) - the few extra thousand are worth it when you run out of space."
OR,I got a defective iPhone XR. The screen is defective. There’s a blue shade on all the four sides of the screen. The phone’s working completely fine though.  So whoever purchased the phone while unboxing please check your device thoroughly. It was my mistake that i thought that maybe it’s something related to software which will be fixed after software update but it didn’t. And in that belief i skipped my 10 days return policy as well. I still don’t blaim amazon because i have purchased my Airpods from them as well. But still appario should not sell defective products to customers. Now i have to go through a hassle of getting the screen replaced from service centre and for that service centre will keep my phone for at least 7-10 days. It’s disappointing that i have to go through all this for a brand new phone. The reason why i didn’t upload a pic is bcuz it will not be visible in a pic taken from another phone.
CG,ALL good
OR,"I chose iPhone XR over x. The reasons are, it is 6.1-inch display and supports dual sim. the Battery Durability longs last. I got the Brand New peace (made in 2019, September) without any defect."
OR,"During the great India sale, I saw this model on offer and my sister was dying to get a new phone since her old phone was barely keeping up. I finally made up my mind,, arranged the funds and got it for my sister."
OR,"Phone looks beautiful. I bought it just one month before thru Amazon, when I put my sim it's speaker has not been working , it is difficult to listen voice sometimes it becomes disconnected. Although my android phone is working good at the same place. I don't know whom should I contact about my complaint."
OR,"After transition from Android to iOS, I felt Android is more user friendly compared to iOS."
CG,I am not able to activate iphone after several attempts. Today only i purchased.
OR,Hello friends!! This is my honest review after using it for almost 2 months. I was using android since last seven years but then I decided to go for iPhone. Here are the pros and cons according to me which I have felt after using it for almost 2 months
CG,So upgrading from 6S+ to XR. First reactions:
OR,Everything look good but I never expect.
CG,"Upgraded from 5s to xr after 3 years of 5s use. Purchased it at ₹37999 after low battery issues with 5s. Why I choose xr rather than iPhone 8 ,7 or even 6s even when I bought 5s after 3 years of its initial launch is"
OR,"Before I start this review I’ll let you know, I love the Apple brand and I’ve never used a 1080p OLED phone in my life (This screen seems perfectly normal to me). That being said I’ll dive into the review. I got this phone on the Prime day sale and I’ve been using it for almost a month now and here are my thoughts about this phone."
OR,Got this product in the amazon flash sale and got a decent discount. Have been using the device for a few days and can certainly say that this iPhone has the best battery life till date. Phone lasted for almost 30 hours with heavy usage. The face recognition has certainly been improved from iPhone X. The only thing I dislike about the phone is the Screen Quality. You won’t find any major difference in the screen quality unless and until you stream Netflix or watch YouTube. Overall I feel this is one of the best iPhones apple has launched.
CG,You will always feel cheated after buying an iPhone. It will get cheaper by every next 2-3 months.
OR,"I have been using this phone for a while now. When I decided to buy this phone I checked on negative reviews first and after buying thought of using it first and then give a feedback. This is the perfect Phone with all advanced features for a normal user, which is worth for the price. Moving unto the flaws seen on the feedbacks, most of them complaining about the display being low resolution and LCD. In my opinion you won’t spot any difference with other iPhone displays. Another thing I’ve seen than lot of people complaining about the single camera, however, the picture quality you get will amuse you."
OR,"Bought this during Prime sale. I love to use Apple products because of its simplicity. I was using iPhone 6 and thought of updating. While the XS and XS Max are more than a Lakh in India, iPhone XR is bang for the buck. The prime day deal was more sweet and surprise to me. The operation and touch responses are silky smooth. Dual Sim with the eSIM works like a charm. Rear camera is awesome with face detection AI Bookeh in Portrait mode. Screen resolution is very good and crisp without any pixel issues. It lacks 3D Touch but Apple incorporated Taptic Engine which will be updated to replace 3D Touch functionality eventually (though some are present now, it is limited). Some APPs are not good in the notch area though but it is ok to manage. Overall a nice update."
CG,Received the product next day only but packaging was not good as it is a cellphone box they should cover it with some thing  Phone is working fine but some times apps automatically closes I am a bit confused if it is a genuine product or not  I would suggest people not to buy from amazon you should go to your nearest store and buy it
CG,I am a recent convert from Android. I have used Samsung and Xiaomi phones earlier. Here is my initial impression:
OR,"Don’t get swayed by some lame reviewers on YouTube. If u r holding out for an iPhone purchase then this is the real deal. The Xr is a jack of all trades although not excelling in any. The A12 Bionic is a beast,n’uff said already, the stereo speakers sound sweet and battery life is great. I found the most bashed about lcd display very pragmatic for everyday use.The portrait shots taken with the camera look a stunner.With the reason price cut , this has turned out to be the VFM iPhone ever made"
CG,Received product yesterday and product looks perfectly awesome.
OR,Excellent phone. I am using it since 3 months. No problem. Classy product. Bought during Diwali sale @39k. Excellent battery backup lasting more than a day. Mind that I am a heavy user. Excellent photos. SIRI works well. No issues faced. Must go for it over other Chinese product in this price segment.
OR,Iphone not working since I opened the box. Apple support of little help. Amazon not taking the return. Asking for a report from Apple. Now I have to chase Apple to get a report. Nightmare starts when you buy from Amazon.
CG,There are many pros about this phone which you must be already aware of . I would like to point out at cons
OR,Face ID and front camera portrait mode isn't working just after 3 months of purchase. It must be a problem of true depth sensor. My city (Imphal) apple servicing centre doesn't allow me to take for servicing and tells me to go to Guwahati (Assam) for this problem. May be a coincidence because this problem happened when I used amazon basics 10w fast wireless charger which I combine with xiaomi quick charge 3
CG,I was using iphone 6 since last three years before switching to Iphone XR. The following are the things that impressed me the most.
CG,Camera superb
OR,I bought this iPhone XR from October Amazon Great Indian Festival at deep discount. At Rs 38000 after all discounts were applied was a WOW deal. THANK YOU Amazon.
OR,"Nothing can beat iPhone. This is my fourth phone (iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 8 and now this) purchased from Amazon. All are excellent phones. Except for screen resolution, iPhone XR is nothing less than XS or XS Max. In fact, the battery life is twice as that of iPhone 8. Face recognition is excellent even in dark while android phones lack this technology. White is a beautiful color. Delivery was before scheduled deadline and in good external packing."
OR,"I was bit worried about the authenticity of buying iphone online with unknown seller and by paying huge amount ,I took the  Risk but i would say amazon and seller  has done a wonderful job ,i checked the product  in apple website and its a genuine product with 1 year warranty..iphone is iphone with best processor,camera ,good battery life ,good for gaming and with  regular  updates from apple .."
CG,IOS:
CG,It’s a very awesome mobile. Overall it’s really good. Hats off to apple that they provide these kinda of awesome products.
CG,The iPhone XR goes blank the next day!!!
OR,"Was sceptical at first. But after I received the phone it’s good and in mint condition. I am upgrading from iPhone 7 and it’s worth it. My iPhone 7 was 3 years old, and was lagging before I took the leap. Camera is more like the android phone with some Chinese lens I think. Battery life is so soothing! Face recognition is like butter. (Don’t know what will happen in the future) best part upgrading is the screen  size. Totally worth it. Videos are a bit dull but for the cost it’s worth it!! Thank you amazon for not sending a duplicate phone."
OR,Well after buying this iPhone i am never switching back to android.
CG,In two months the phone got destroyed its screen is filled with water its ip certification is nil bloody ios.....
OR,Battery quality is worst I have honor 8c and it gives 2 days backup and this phone last only 12 hours with medium usage no fast charger takes tradatitional 3 hours for full charging if u want to waste your money then go for it if u r not brand conscious buy other brands phone with much more better  configurations that too almost half of its price
OR,"Their is No earpods no lightning cable or connector in that box and will call after few minutes it blanks the call,not even a bip. Kindly give me some suggestions to rectify that"
OR,"Got it for 38k during prime early access, one of the best purchase for value of money is considered. iOS 13 future releases might make it even more snappier and battery consumption efficiency. Played WOW Blitz in 60FPS and found no issues. Will post the PUBG and Fortnite review in few days. Battery back up is about 6hrs screen on time for apps usage scenario."
OR,"I ordered this phone on Diwali offer. The phone which I got first had display issue , so I got replacement for that.my previous phone was iPhone 6 Plus.  After one week of using this phone, these are my honest review.  Firstly the phone has excellent battery life . For average use, the battery lasts more than a day easily. Although charging takes time ie about 2 to 3 hours from 10% to 100%. As I am used to iPhone home button, I’m feeling a bit uncomfortable with this phone as it has no home button. You have to swipe up every time from bottom to top to unlock the phone. It has no finger print sensor . So it’s a bit difficult to unlock while ur in bed as u have to put ur face in front of the phone for FACE ID. Reach ability is an issue if u use one handed. Especially while using Facebook, when u have to swipe down from bottom line to make ur finger reach the top screen clicking options. Display of the screen is a bit below iPhone 6 Plus. So all in all the phone is just about satisfactory."
CG,Good at 52k (the price at which I got the phone). The phone wasn’t worth 76k when it was launched but at 52k it justifies itself.
CG,"I have bought it during prime sales , aside from discount i have bought it by paying just 36k"
CG,"It's the latest offering from I phone. Simply great. Camera is superb. The glass back looks ultra premium, though I would suggest you to get a back protective case as glass is fragile. Got it in white and had to pay 1400 extra but it looks the best in white. You are spending 60000 on a phone so what's 1400 more to get the best"
OR,"Fantastic mobile. Nicely integrated hardware and software nothing ever comes close to an Apple product. Smooth touch no lag, face identification works well. Camera is good. Battery lasts for 24 hours with moderate usage. Superb audio and video quality and iOS updates are always smooth. The apps are wonderful.👍Amazon delivery was on dot. the same offer is available at authorized reseller stores which happens around the time Apple launches a new version of iPhone."
CG,IPhone SIM CARD SLOT NOT WORKING right from the beginning.
OR,"Dude i was confused first that which one i should buy oneplus 7pro or iphone xr, so i choosen xr for 40k on offer and every thing ia good but i am dissapointed with tha camera quality and display quality really i have iphone 7plus also but the display is far far better then xr and the camera is also better but i know iphone 7plus has dual camera and that's ok but dude detailing is missing and also zooming is also missing we get digital zoom which reduces tha quality...."
OR,"In my initial review, I said that the iPhone XR was the best iPhone for most people right, and my thoughts about it haven't changed six months later. This is still the best iPhone in the market, offering the same smooth and terrific user experience as the more expensive iPhone XS and XS Max, but with the knowledge that you're also getting the best battery life. In fact, the battery life is at par, if not better, to what the P30 Pro and the Galaxy S10+ offer and that's saying something."
CG,"I am facing cellular network issue with every new update. As per my understanding, Hardware is not compatible with the OS."
CG,I have purchased this Apple iPhone XR (64GB) - Black for my use.
CG,"I got it during great Indian festival for 38,000rs. Great value for the price."
CG,it has a receiver failer problem
CG,It was my first iphone till date i was an android user . But believe me once you get over these phones you wont switch it away
OR,iPhone XR is still a great buy. The price VS performance ratio on this phone makes it a very sensible buy. If you don’t care about the latest and greatest this one year old offering from Apple is a far better buy. Only down side on the phone are as follows:-
CG,"Never thought about purchasing XR but couldn't stop myself when i saw this deal . Taken sudden decision and bought this. Very much worried till the delivery suspecting that the product would be refurbished or duplicate. But amazon kept thier commitment, i received a brand new orginal iphone."
OR,"First of all the Face ID is crazy fast and accurate even during pitch darkness. The phone is fast and smooth, you don’t feel like you are having just 3Gb of RAM, it handles anything you through at it without a hitch. The phone does feel premium and at the same time delicate because the backside is glass,”as you know glass is glass and glass will break”. The pictures taken from the camera are good but the lack of night scape sort of things is a con. Overall the phone is great, although the side bezels are thick, you get used to it. The LCD screen does not lack anything compared to the OLED’s in day to day usage. You just stop thinking those things when you are using daily."
OR,I was looking to upgrade from my iPhone 6 and was confused about iPhone 11 & iPhone XR. Decided to go for iPhone XR just from the cost perspective. Only from Camera and Processor POV there is an upgrade in iPhone 11 rest remains the same.
CG,Bought it for 45k during sale
OR,"I had been using iphone 8 plus before and not a single time did I ever experience that phone heating up even after extensive usage. This piece however heats up to the extent making it uncomfortable to hold. If I use it for less than 10 mins, it works fine but any usage beyond that makes it hot. And on top of that, if the brightness level is set to max, its becomes an iron box(pun intended). Not expected off an apple device !"
OR,"the screen has a slight dot at the bottom which i noticed while fixing guard. If it comes out as mfr defect apple will certainly fix it. but doesn't seem serious, will take to apple while it is still in warranty to know more and update."
OR,Got the 128 GB model since an iPhone almost always run out of space and never have the option for an SD card like Android devices.
CG,"Overall the product is good from face id to Liquid retina. One thing surely standout for me is its surrounding speakers, they are really good(as per my experience), i got impressed With the work they have put in speakers. Sound is loud and clear."
OR,"M an iphone addict... my first was iphone 4, then 6 which my brother gifted me but this time i upgraded to xr with my own salary n m really happy ... specially the battery life.... and  As i dont use camera much so potrait mode is not of much use to me.. face id recognition very nice... though u dont get the feel of holding iphone as it little bit big and on bulky side as compared to my iphone 6.... rest fuctioning everything is smooth so i think its worth the purchase... and if u have iphone 6 or 7 than only go for upgrade as i did lot of research and 8 and xs and xr they almost similar except for few features...."
OR,"I am more or less stuck with the iOS platform because of the iwatch since I love its functionality. Upgraded from my 3yr old iPhone 7, was actually waiting for prices to drop post September this year  but when Amazon came up with an unbelievable prime deal, I couldn’t resist!"
OR,"Easy to use, serves the purpose. I was an android guy for like last 7 years before that was using blackberry in between switched to ios as i used iphone 5c but at that time i was a bit disappointed may be because quite young i was and a bit techie but now i use my phone for basic purposes like calls, whats app, email, social media n bit gaming n music so it really handles that well though i was a bit hesitant at first as i was used to of finger touch sensor but seriously face recognition is damn good it works like a charm even when there is no light, so if you want no nonsense stuff n if it suits your requirements then go for it as now a days even droids are equally expensive in-fact some are more expensive like fold, razr etc. so just listen to your heart and buy ios or android and you wont go wrong, though i got mine in an offer for ₹43000 for 128 GB variant"
OR,"Purchased this phone for a friend and he is very happy with the performance of the phone. Camera quality and features are the industry standard. For anyone refraining from buying an iPhone because it has only a single SIM slot,  please be informed that this Phone does support Dual SIM if you use E-SIM. Airtel and Jio, for now, has E-SIM facility. For a more detailed review do visit my review website at excitedneurons(dot)com"
OR,"Awesome product !! Far better than spending almost double for Xs, XS MAX, 11 as the difference is only display and camera. Otherwise everything is same. It would be definitely a bigger upgrade if anyone is switching from iphone 8 or 8+ to it. The entire UI is different. Icing on the cake is the PRIVACY, its the utmost priority of Apple it seems. Without you face id, nobody can see even the notifications. Its a must buy product."
CG,"I still don’t understand why people are crazy about iPhone. I bough this phone for 42k in great Indian sale couldn’t find much difference so for. It’s been a week now. My old android is doing all the operation faster then this which detected my face quickly. And that has fingerprint support also. I am also crazy about this phone. My friend told that he will never go back to android again. That’s the one reason for me to buy this phone. Let me wait for one more month to become addicted.  Till then I’ll leave the rating to 4*. When you think that this phone is expensive, that’s proving that this phone is for royal customers :p. Go for it if you are affordable."
OR,I have received this product with manufacturing defect in it. Screen has LED bleeding problem. Contacted the service team of Apple and they are ready to replace.
OR,"The iPhone XR is by far the best that Apple had to provide in the recent years with no doubt. Right from the camera to its horsepower battery backup, everything is top notch."
CG,I bought XR after 11 came out. I read a few articles and saw a few video reviews which said that the real difference between the phones was the camera and that it was negligible and not worth the price difference.
CG,"My Opinion-I don't know why people are saying it's an excellent display, personally i don't like the display at all, No doubt colour accuracy is good, Touch response is good, but it not that sharp, text looks blurry."
OR,"I've been using my iPhone XR for over 10 months now. So far, everything's hunky-dory."
OR,"Thanks to amazon for giving it for great deal, iphone xr 128gb is absolutely fantastic, with good battery life, camera, and performance. Since 6 months waiting to upgrade from 6s, compare to 6s xr a bit bigger in screen size for me apart from that its a great device to use, thanks to the seller 3 years back got 6s from the same seller and it still works pretty well without any issues."
OR,"I love this phone... especially since I wanted it for a long time... would recommend it for both apple owners and those looking to become iPhone owners...camera quality is amazing... was able to activate the esim without hazzels.. 2 reasons that I switched my old phone for...size was a concern initially since I was accustomed to only iPhone 5, SE, 6... lightning cable is a disadvantage  with this phone as the charging point n headset points are the same... but I knew it when I was getting it... so got used to it now"
OR,I believe firmly that this is the Best Affordable Phone Apple has ever made!!!
OR,"Battery life will surely amaze the buyer, I use to charge my iPhone 7 Plus at the 100 percent to my office at 10AM  and while returning by 7 PM it used to be approx 7-8 percent remaining. I use my phone for basic tasks and PUBG during break. Now when XR came to my hand the very first day I forgot to charge my phone to 100 percent and took it to my office at 62 percent. Amazingly it had 33 percent charge while I was leaving my office and I even played 3 evoground matches of pubg that day during my break. It was my dream to have long lasting iOS enabled devices which came true with this spectacular device. One should blindly go for it if performance and battery is your huge concern."
OR,Wow Wow Apple iPhone XR Looks Amazing In Stunning White Colour Thanks To Amazon For Giving For Best Price In The Market Love You Amazon For Quick Delivery But Packaging  Is Not That Great It Should Be In More Secure Packaging  When Comes To Phone After 8 Years I am Using Again iPhone Before I Used iPhone 4s Now Again Coming Back From Android Phones To IOS Makes mee feel Happy And This Phone Is a beast go for it .
OR,"I was always an iPhone user  till 8+ , then thought of changing to note 8 I loved that phone too but over the period of time I started realising there is nothing like IOS and iPhone. After using two high end androids (i keep changing phones) I witched back to iPhone and OMG I must say it has even become better it is so smooth like a butter on pan and IPhone X r is beauty, Liquid Retina is awesome and beautiful will not make you miss oled also the battery back up is woooowww .  This is the first ever phone I bought thru AMAZON I was skptical but thought of taking risk and yes Amazon delivered what they promised thru FREEDOM sale got a very good deal for 128 gb everyday I fall in love with this phone .."
OR,"6.1 inches screen for a phone is pretty good, feels heavy, but all that pales in comparison after the actual features of the phone are unlocked.I was informed that phone can be tracked even when switched off as per the new ios 13 update, camera quality is better , both front and back , fast charging too is great, i like the idea that the body is aluminium made as compared to the latest which after checking and reviewing holds up better after drop tests, face id recognition is great, but need back up in the form of app lock for unauthorized usage.Overall a great phone, at a amazing price, do not miss the chance to buy it, even if you feel it is heavy on your wallet, you wont get such a good phone loaded with features else where.Its like how the iphone 7 was the benchmark for future models , same goes for this phone."
OR,"Excellent deals offered by Amazon 38k after bank discount.......best iPhone for every aspect.......good camera ...... battery backup excellent......... looks elegant.....feels premium in hand.....and  one think i said to all , though it's a 720p display but display is excellent quality.......there is no panicked about it....and also played 1080p video in YouTube.......so .....go for it.......this is best budget iPhone at this price point......thank you Amazon........"
CG,I bought 128g  at 57k performing much faster and more smoother experience on an iPhone. Battery life is above average. app switching is lightning fast.
CG,I love it <3
CG,I phone always like a dream phone... purchased this  in diwali sale in 38 k rs. My previous phone was s8 moved to xr and no regrates.
CG,Thank you amazon i got iphone XR 64GB black variant for 38000/- on big billion day sale
OR,"Top end model IPhone XR with the Price of 42k😎 Extremely satisfied... I was an android user for 6yrs and this was my first upgrade to iPhone.. Battery Standby is just next to impossible in any smart phones these days, Face ID fab!(One dis - If I covet half of my face during bike riding, it doesn’t recognise me😂)"
OR,"Good phone. Go for it if you want an iPhone experience. Truth be told, I do miss a finger print sensor. But, at updating to iOS 13 the performance of the Face ID head become significantly faster."
CG,"I will not recommend anyone to buy XR,if you are considering iphone from camera perspective."
OR,"There is nothing to dislike about this phone. I forgot Android after using this. This is superior class,u ll feel it when you hold it. Don't be a sad face for 3GB Ram, it's better than 8GB Android. Facelock can recognize you in dark. There is no finger print scanner. But still it's no issues"
CG,First of all got it for 38000.  Great at this price but or maximum at 45k nothing more than that for this phone.
OR,I was previously a user of iPhone SE and was wonderstruck with its abilities. But due to battery life had to look at a changeover. However looking at the price was little suspicious whether the phone would be worth for the money. Here are the pros n cons...
OR,"This phone is good , i got it at Rs.45000 during this diwali sale, but after using this i was bound to think on the various aspects : considering the Ram and ROM ( 3 GB and 64 GB ) in this case , is the price ok , i felt that its really overpriced, we can get more features in Phones like Redmi Note 8 pro which is priced at around 16K ( discounts and bank offer are separate) this means we are paying for brand name or goodwill price simply to Apple. Then why we are not going for One plus models made in china as Apple i phone is also made in china for your information."
OR,"This is my first iPhone after 10 years of being an android user. This review is after using this phone for 2 months. The performance has been top notch, battery life is very good considering  most of my days are moderate to heavy usage I still find 20-30 % battery the next day. Camera is good too but at time you miss the secondary lens for portraits and portraits don’t work on objects."
OR,"I am writing this review after using this phone for more than 10 days now . I upgraded this phone from iPhone 7 . The phone is really good , worth a buy if its on good sale .  128gb - around 55k"
OR,"I am using apple from last 7 years. And never change apple phone frequently. I was using iPhone 6s from last 3 years but due to less space and batter backup, I need to upgrade it. I choose Apple iPhone because it's in between AppleXS and Apple X. Hardware A12 bionic chipset with 3 GB ram give my phone high speed on top of 128GB space thrilled the whole experience. In this new apple XR I still missed the center button especially when I play the games. Camera output is an amazing especially back camera. Also would like to appreciate the battery backup, I hardly change more than one time in 24hours. Now I do not need to my battery back always along with me ROFL."
OR,The best decision that I took was to give away my Samsung galaxy S8 and get this phone. I was skeptical at first considering on paper specs and the obvious inferior display. But I used it in a retail store and I didn’t mind the display at all. It was one drawback that i could live with if i was getting everything much better than on the android side at the price range.
OR,"Iphone is good. It dont have fingerprint reader, only faceid and password."
CG,iPhone XR performs better than those specs that it showed in paper for XR.
CG,A reasonably good product if you are into the Apple ecosystem and don't want to splurge.
CG,"Looks great and behaves well too. Camera is quite good for its resolution. Excellent battery life. Thank god I got rid of my android phone, finally!"
CG,Gifted my wife with this phone for her birthday. Thanks to amazon for the fast delivery and maintaining their quality standards.
OR,"iPhone XR with A12 bionic chip with 3 GB RAM is fast. This is my 1st iPhone and I am very impressed with it's performance, processing power is fast and iPhone is very easy to use and it fits in my hand very well."
OR,"This is my first iPhone. I’m happy with the performance of XR. With hdfc credit card discount and exchange of old phone, it costed me 49.7k. Both front and rear Camera quality is great, battery lasts whole day with normal use. Face recognition is better than OnePlus 6T. XR’s almost HD display  can give tough competition to major FHD phones, side by side you won’t be able to spot any difference. Display is so crisp, no eye strain. And ios is buttery smooth. XR is more value for money than XS or X"
CG,Best mobile compare to other Apple mobiles
OR,Awesome cellphone i have ever used..i have switched from Android(OP) to ios..which I believe..it cannot be compared with any os we have  in market..coming to the device it’s really awesome battery on an average use last for a day..i don not play any game..I mostly spend time on Twitter and on other apps...the only worst thing i find is the charging rate which really sucks...it takes appx an hour to full juice. Camera has been the best...not as good as of Samsung s series and note series  but for me its the best...face recognition works like charm...
CG,Its Apple so no comments on their quality and user experience. Fabulous purchase got it at 43K which is worth and enjoying it
CG,"Got this iPhone XR 128GB in an awesome deal of rs. 42,999 thanks to amazon."
OR,"need i say anything about this phone! it's a bomb. i bought the product red 64GB varient and let me tell you its sexier than it appears in the pictures. camera quality is really good. the portraits are awesome even though it has a single lens. the bezzel looks a bit wide compared to XS and XS Max, but if you are upgrading from Iphone 8 Plus or lower you won't find it different. The liquid display is really nice with wide range of colors displayed really well. i got this during the independence day sale for Rs.52K and its definitely a great deal. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!"
CG,To review iPhone! Probably the only one I could afford but totally worth it.
OR,"This is the best value for money you can get. iPhone 11 has only a marginal improvement compared to iPhone XR. But the performance is almost at par with them. I had an iPhone 6s, which ran almost 4 years. Touch and feel you get from your iphone is unparalleled with any other phone.(I have used all platforms)"
OR,"I bought a iphone XR  ,Which has some screen and camera issues  ,screen is freezing ,Amazon custome r Care talk like we did mistake ,not gud behaviour called to amazon ,they asked to go Apple store,already visited there from apple support we got information battery already replaced of this IMIE number.I told them ,but they were not agree,they again and again saying go there,we cant replace it.we just requested also said we paid 50000 for that but they dont agree,so if you buying pn and you have any issue in phone even it would be damaged they are not going to replace IT,and this seller is selling refurbish product."
CG,"Great phone! Best ux in the class, no offense android but why does my calculator need permission to access my contacts?"
OR,"Not sure whether genuine product. Bought it on the first day of amazon sale. Within 15days, got a vertical line in the middle of display- see photos. Have bought 5 apple devices in the past and never had any problem with any of them so far. Since the return window closes within 19 days have to now take it to apple service center. Seriously makes me thing about the originality of the product."
OR,Good phone. Great screen size. But apple still has not fixed low light shooting. It still looks like crap when compared to oppo or Samsung or the +one series. It’s incredible how we end up paying so much for an iPhone which still doesn’t get its camera right. Battery life is good. Downside is the replacement of the phono jack for headphones with its lightning socket which operates both charger and headphones - which means you can only do one thing
OR,I just got my iPhone XR 128GB White phone. I feel am lucky to get 12% discount on MRP. In addition 10% discount on my Credit card. Also an 2% instantaneous cashback on a special day. Total paisa-vasool!!
CG,Got it after discount for 43000+ additional value of 4000 on phone exchange.
OR,"Feels like got robbed by apple I bought it for 64990 and after 10 days of launching iPhone 11 the price of this phone reduced to 54990 10000 drastic drop. Its bionic A12 chip is good and smooth but battery performance is bad, and it doesn't even have  Fingerprint sensor, the face detection wont work at all angles. Need to stop buying this apple product."
OR,"The iPhone is a great phone, but I am really impressed with amazon. I recieved the phone in less than 36hrs and checked the warranty and coverage on the Apple website. Everything was right in place, turns out I was unnecesarily hesitant to purchase the phone online. Also got one year screen insurance free in addition to the heavy discount!"
CG, My review after one month of use
OR,Pathetic experience with this phone . Bought it for 60K and not worth the price . Assembled in China and lot many issues with battery and other features . Better to buy from stores which are assembled in India and are cheaper with better quality check . Learnt hard way to never but electronics from amazon .
OR,"I hot this product with 37K during big billion sale  ,and the product is super but it is not for you if you are a camera freak . Back camera and front camera both are good but front camera night vision is not enough . Over all battery life is good . Potrait mode  photos also good (without having a dual back camera)"
OR,"Not gonna lie while I was transferring my iCloud stuff, the phone got heated up to the point where I had to switch it off and then start over again."
CG,The best camera and feel of security...
CG,"This is my 4th apple product. As usual, it’s apple works fine . Will easily can last upto 4 years. Battery- is just awesome, can last u full working day with heavy useage."
OR,"My second iphone and 3rd apple product so i can clearly say that if you are the first time user of apple product then you will surely give iphone XR 5 star rating but if you have been a long run user then you will think twice to give even 4 star also to this, may be after demise of Steve jobs apple has compromised with its quality, where as in till 2015 there were no comparison with any phone with iphone but now few products are giving strong comparison to it, apple is now only encashing its name but it will not good for the future of apple because now a days consumers are more aware, and if you are not giving 5 star to iphone the. Probably you have dealt with a wring product, sorry but not completely happy with XR. May be i will think next time when i will be upgrading my phone."
CG,Best battery life in an iPhone.
CG,"Awesome experience. Camera, performance and battery life is great. Totally worth every penny spent!"
CG,1.The battery life is good.
OR,"I got a very bad product from Amazon. This was really not expected from Amazon. i don't know whether its an issue from Apple or Amazon. From the day it has come it started giving me issues.Issues related Hardware like Distorted sound i.e. Other person cannot listen the voice clearly, voice becomes like mute, and Software Issues like Phone getting hanged [NEVER HEARD IOS HANGING], Not able to unlock the phone moreover not able to recieve a call. I am the first time user to the iPhone and got this sort of bad experience which was never thought of or never expected.I am really disappointed with the product.Also I think Battery Life can be improved. Camera quality and Face reader is OK."
CG,Thanks to Amazon for putting it on sale for 43K . Wonderful phone to have at such price . Battery life is perfect for heavy users . Although a double camera would have made it perfect.
OR,Honestly speaking I love apple products due to the simple design and fluid user experience with the products. I am a fan of black but i got the Product RED as part of the amount goes for HIV research.
CG,"This phone is just awesome. Screen is really good and bright, you can’t really make a difference between the screen and an AMOLED screen. I have compared them side by side. You can’t really say the difference."
CG,Note: No fingerprint reader in the phone so please consider it as the review of face id.
CG,"Received a faulty set, had to take it to a service centre within 2 months and they had to replace it with a new phone."
OR,"Good purchase during the sale. I like it. Moved from 6 to XR, which makes it bulky in your hand. But i will get use to it. Battery backup is good. I love the photos clicked in Protrait mode."
OR,"Good phone. Being a 1st time user of ios, i liked it a lot. Although the compromises made for this phone like inferior display, big bezels nd notch are cleary visible and annoying. Battery life is top notch although supplied 5 watt charger is a trash. Using my iPad charger to charge it fast. Camera gives dslr quality pics in daylight nd outdoors but night photos are below average. In total a good package to try out apple ecosystem."
OR,"I purchased this phone from amazon during the freedom sale got it for an effective price 49k . This is my first iphone and honestly not regretting a bit . I was worried about the specs such as LCD screen and camera quality but it did not disappoint me this one camera on XR is 1000 times better than those Three cameras on my samsung A50 and the LCD screen hardly makes a difference its crystal clear and vibrant . The battery life is just beautiful it can stand for 48hours on a single charge . Overall it a good buy , Apple is never great with specs but the always kills it"
CG,The phone was not getting power on..
OR,"It's a fabulous product. I'm sure everyone knows it's quality. Only one thing that I should mention here regarding the battery. I was definitely expecting a better battery life in the normal mode. It's merely giving a day with normal usage in that mode. However, in the Low Power Mode, its giving a great battery life without compromising any regular features of the phone."
OR,"My experience with iPhones was never bad but this time with iPhone XR the phone started hanging from the very first month, it has not yet been a month and is already hanging.. did not expect this from apple gadgets. everything else is good the battery life , camera but its a little heavy, heats up and has started HANGING."
OR,Since from a lot of months i have been waiting to buy an iPhone XR in great Indian sale and as more than I expected I bought this mobile for a huge price drop thanks to Amazon for that.I ordered on Saturday noon 1 Pm and I got the product on the next day early morning 7 Am a super fast delivery from Amazon.
CG,"If you are an Android user, you will find iPhone difficult in many respects. Firstly iPhone is not google friendly. Google updates will not happen automatically. Many free apps found in Android phones are not available in iPhone set up or you have to pay dearly. And there are many moreeeeeee......"
CG,This is my first iPhone and I am being excited. Close to a month now and I am still saying my new iPhone.
CG,"Hi Team,"
CG,I dont understand why would anyone use any other phone other than Iphone.  God please forgive their ignorance. They know not what they are missing
CG,My iphone was excellent bt i want my iphone complete bill...in box I can’t receive bill
CG,Waited for a long time to get this mobile
OR,Want to return but u are not accepting it.. Bad experiance on amazon... Really paying a huge amount and giving bad quality products....
OR,The product is awesome i have brought the same in Sep & there has been no issues it’s currently running on IOS 13.2.2 & the phone is very fast it also has e-sim which is a major plus point face recognition is very good without any hassle & the battery is good enough to take it for a day & half. As this phone was bought after APPLE TV + was released we have received a annual subscription free with the product from 1st Nov 2019
OR,Pls pls don't buy from amazon or any other site buy it from store because i got a defected xr its face id is not working and it is having heating issues and now amazon is also not replacing it
OR,"This is my third iPhone and I must say - each time Apple introduces an iPhone, they improve a lot in each model. iPhone XR is one of best selling iPhone for year 2018. Its not that cheap but still standout in crowd. Its not expensive than iPhone XS but still have all the features same as other top models- only difference is OLED screen but I can live with that. Recently introduced iPhone 11 and XR have only one difference which is of Price. Most of the features are exactly same. Best Battery backup ever in an iPhone I must say. Soothing and flawless iOS.  Camera is more than average and very much improved as compared to previous generations. Glass frame back and front and very appealing to eyes. Overall, a satisfactory experience with this device. A must buy if are considering iPhone 11 but have low budget."
OR,"Fingerprint reader given one star coz it has Face ID 😂, it works lightning fast (even in the dark) , super build quality, battery backup is nuts (works for more than 2 days with decent use) , Camera quality is amazing for photography and videography. Preferred product over iphone X if screen quality is not the main thing to notice (doesn't matter if you don't watch 4K videos on youtube)"
CG,"Using an iPhone after 6 years. Have been using Android and the transition is bit difficult as I am used to having different functions. Happy with product, it is not as bulky as I assumed. Vibrant colour and smooth functioning. Delivery was also very quick."
CG,Looks: 5 /5
CG,Display 3.7/5 — but u will get use too it not too bad better than expensive android phones  (DONT BUY IF DISPLAY IS YOUR PRIORITY)
CG,Only face recognition and no fingerprint. I think the phone is very good. Screen could be little smaller However these days only big screen phones are being launched so lets wait for future.
OR,Heyaa! I just purchased Iphone couple of weeks back and its been 15days of my experience with iphone! This is the first ever Iphone for me and im super excited to buy this....here goes my quick review in brief about the entire phone specs!
CG,3 years with iPhone 6s and never faced a lag or hang . Battery started draining faster obviously 3 years and heavy usage did that .
OR,"It is very sad to say that Amazone allow to seller to sell the Damage iPhone to their site,.I purchase iphone XR but after receiving it is found that speaker was not good,vibration problem and camera quality was bad.I contacted to Amazone customer care but they refuse to do the same.”, Amazone customer told  that everything ll be look by iPhone care.I went there and they told me to submit the phone.They r not Exchanging  the same.Its been feel like I m using 2nd hand phone.Really very disappointed."
CG,It’s good to be back with Apple and IOS!!
OR,"It's my first iphone ..i had also read a review about this phone which made me convinced to buy this particular product and model,though color yellow is my own choice,actually I wanted to buy iPhone 11 but when I read a review about this phone i got convinced bcoz sometimes it's really difficult to decide between to best things. Guys whosoever wants to buy iPhone 10 xr plz go for it it's a beautiful phone with all latest feature. Picture quality, screen touch, face recognition,battery life every thing is perfect,And trust me u won't regret..!!💕."
CG,Great deal.. Got it for 42999 for 128 GB version
CG,Pros:
CG,I had s4 and SE...bought this because it is from apple..I am not a techie.. now I like SE
OR,"I received the phone on 21.10.2019, the phone operation was fine till 23.10.2019 and from next day it showed NO SIM after that all other sims were tried but the phone always displayed no sim installed and never worked again, this is the first time I had such a bad experience with Amazon, I was very very upset and today handed over the I phone Xr 128 GB to the authorised service centre in Kolkata, their response was not very positive and they will give feedback in 4-6 days time."
CG,Fantastic Apple phone in this price range.
CG,It is genuine and good phone. Esim facility is not working. May have to check with the service provider as well.
OR,The name Apple defines everything. Awesome phone. The delivery was on time thanks to Amazon.
CG,"Good battery life and attractive design,  amazon offered great discount so went for it,  little heavy but that's OK.  Overall very nice product"
OR,"Thanks for Amazon for genuine product and safe delivery. Couple of month back i bought this mobile for 55,999. I am quite shock to see the reduction in price. However, The mobile works absolutely fine and truely a flagship phone. Smooth UI, Outstanding camera and average battery life."
CG,"Delivered with in 2 days, Thanks to Amazon Prime."
CG,"Best iphone out there coming from iphone 6 , XR just blown my mind away . Below are pros n cons of the phone"
OR,"Phone not working. Phone was autotyping and then eventually frozen screen. I bought on 15th oct and barely used for few days. No support from amazon for replacement for defective piece. One thing to note that when I received this piece, it was in a locked bag. However, there should have been some QR code on bag which the delivery boy scans. There was no such code on the bag and the delivery center sent the qr code as whatsapp on my phone."
CG,Indeed a great phone. After a month usage I can say following:
OR,"While on call, if you want to see the screen, it takes time to turn on. So if you want to disconnect or add another call, frst you have to wait for the screen to turn on.. which is very irritating. One can’t even press the home button as it is not there in xr. Even aftr pressing power key, screen doesn’t turn on immediately nd pressing it twice results in disconnection of call. 😤😤"
CG,Thank u amazon for letting me hv this phone for under 40k. Everything about the phone is exceptional and for a change battery is excellent. Camera is good too and with dual sim capabilities the phone is sure a winner. The 11 is the same phone with just dual camera but 20k higher. So it didn’t make sense to buy the iPhone 11.
OR,iOS 13 is a failed attempt from apple. The phone doesn't have a smooth wifi or network connectivity. Its worse than some other phones half the cost. Absolute disappointment. Even older phones like 5s and 6s don't show network issues while the iPhone XR has these issues. Apple support is clueless and can't solve the issue. Disappointed with this apple product. All else is good just that the phones connectivity which is the most important thing for a phone is atrocious. Avoid if u can.
OR,"I’m very happy with this Apple product except call records. I didn’t find any app that suits my iOS XR in the store, rest everything works well."
OR,"Everything on this XR works extremely well but the only problem that i have faced is that there is some kind of manufacturing defect in the camera lens.The photos shot have a black spot kind of smoky.Its only visible when something bright like sky or white wall is shot.Also,I’ve wiped the camera glass many times so it’s not on the camera but the inside lens.Guys,phone is quite good just be careful while purchasing can happen with anyone."
OR,I have been using iPhone XR for about a week and I am impressed with the purchase and the phone has met my expectations. Here are some of the facts:
CG,For: Great battery life for an iPhone
CG,"Pros - good screen resolution, camera quality, battery back up is good. Good screen size."
OR,"I purchased this phone (Apple iPhone XR (128GB) - Black) during the Amazone Deewali sale, working fine and no issues so far. Installation and configuration was pretty easy as my previous phone was also iphone. I have checked and verified the product and it is a genuine one. The convenience part  is copying contacts, photos , audio & video files took less than 2 min. In overall,  phone is  good and i got it for around 50K with a Credit card refund offer of 2.5k back after 3 months. But I didn’t receive the refund so far. Spoke to bank and they advised to get in touch with Amazon. Not sure where to reach now."
OR,"I was a bit skeptical about buying it on Amazon. But happy to say..No regrets at all on this purchase. Works exactly as advertised. Absolutely no issues at all. Great battery life, nice photos. While the other variants of the latest iPhone have oled screen, this one has an lcd screen. But I don't think it is making a difference to me. The screen quality is excellent. Overall very satisfied with this purchase."
CG,First time iOS user. Shifted from android to iOS finally
CG,Reviewing the device after a months of usage.
OR,Battery life 5 hour and heating too much...Amazon se na kharide phone Sayed discount ke Naam pe refurbished phone dete hain....iPhone me heating problem samanya nahi hain....mera phone change kardo amazonwale
OR,"Nice phone got it for rs44000 after discount.with no cost emi from Amazon icici credit card. Red is beautiful. Battery back is good last for more than one day in my case. Performance, quality And finish awesome. Got update to iOS13. Amazon super fast delivery in 14hrs. Phone was covered with innovative tamper proof packaging and a code ,otp was provided to me by sms before delivery. Code to me matched with code on packaging."
OR,There's no fingerprint sensor as its Iphone X series..face lock works good even in dark. Display is good fully visible in outdoors. Nice battery backup. Dual sim makes it awsome i.e one E Sim and normal one. May pay nominal fee for esim to operator. Currently only Jio and Airtel support esim..so please consider that.
CG,I received this product with slight scratch on the camera edges. It can be easily noticeable and
OR,My 1st iPhone. I liked it. Only difficulty I find is I didn’t get much variety Of cases and cover for this model. You have to use for hands to handle this phone because of its size and skin. I purchased it in sell at Rs 46k in Nov 19. I prefer volume keys to be in right hand side and music aux cable on top which makes a mobile easy to handle and operate
OR,I had purchased the Mobile for Gift to My Son. When I started it on 23rd Oct I found that the some of the functions of the Mobile are not working. To my disapointment I could not return as it was not showing the option. The return period was valid but could not return.
OR,I bought a Product Red iPhone XR in the Great Indian Amazon sale in exchange for my 3 year old iPhone 7. I got the 128 GB version for ₹ 40k.
OR,Best value for money apple device right now got this iphone xr for 38k steal price totally worth it i am not an apple fanboy i use my oneplus 7 along with this device the softare smoothness is unmatchable camera is great and brand value is superb but main cons is slow charger it takes almost 3hr to complete the charge and display is also good but flat/accurate colours but i like the saturated one of my 1+ 7 but the quality is very nice closer to 1080 full hd panel for so under 45k is the best apple device you can get but if display is your main priority than oneplus 7t is a better overall device along with fast charging in this price range
CG,I checked the IMEI with Apple once i got the phone and it is genuine
OR,"Hi, i have purchased this phone on 27th sep,  as i am prime member so i got this product on 30th sep.  I have created apple i. D pass word..  Since morning the very next day of product received..  Today is 1st oct 2019.. In a single day..  Even not completing 24 hours..  It is getting hang..  And it took time to almost 4 hours to unlock my device..  Even though i was not able to unlock my screen"
OR,I have been using this Phone for about 5 months. I had used 5s and 6s plus. This phone is definitely a Big Big upgrade from former models. It’s brilliant in every possible way. The two main concerns which I had earlier with iPhones were battery life and secondary SIM card. I’m happy that finally Apple heard us and released this beast. You might wonder about thick bezels and LCD display on this phone. I bet you don’t notice them at all when you get along with this phone. No wonder why XR is the best selling smartphone worldwide. Battery life is excellent. Enough of reviews. Just go for it. You won’t regret at any point of time!
OR,"A superb smartphone at this price range, bought k20 pro a few days back but wanted to get an iPhone, got it on the early prime member sale at an amazing price, everything is perfect, except for the camera which shows a yellowish pictures everytime rest of all battery, screen performance is what I needed the most and this didn’t let me down. Thanks amazon and apple for timely delivery and a best product"
CG, Everything is awesome except battery.
CG,This does not seem to be a genuine product. My phone goes completely silent many times and i have to restart it. The seller is not genuine. Better go for other sellers or offline.
OR,"Really super experience,simply best quality,since 10 eyrs I used android and now feeling ios and iPhone quality,before I used Samsung S9plus which bought for 65k now it’s awailable for 28k means 25k worth product they sold for 65k.So my final  openion is shift to ios and iphone xr is value for money."
CG,Best battery life amongst current iPhones...lightning fast with the most current A12 processor...specs are almost at par with the iPhone XS/XS Max...except for the camera and display. All in all...excellent price/value equation.
CG,I purchase in amazon festive sale at 40000 which is great but if one buy under 50000 at that price also it is amazing
OR,I'm regular Amazon buyer for many years now.Got my first iPhone xr delivered on 7/10/2019.But sorry to inform it stopped working from 21/10/2019.Amazon delivered Apple phone which is a most trusted brand in world.Dont know whose fault it is.I contacted Apple authorised service centre ie. Icare  who has d mobile to Bangalore.And now I'm waiting for their reply.My trust on Amazon is affected
OR,Product is good what we bought from Apple store but what Amazon delivered is not good  I suspect this not good quality product Amazon delivered during sale  with in a month one day this iPhone abruptly went off ND I was not able to on it again
OR,"Very beautiful phone...very long battery life, superb camera quality...thanks a lot Amazon for such great discount during prime day sale n for making it affordable ...very happy with my purchase😊😊😊"
CG,The phone is a little big and handling it single handed might be a problem but size matters ! The display and the face recognition is awesome
OR,"Still now doing great . iPhone XR is a great phone , upgraded from iPhone 8+ , n i am totally satisfied. Yellow is a beautiful colour but the only con is the side bezels n aluminium frame colour."
CG,Good battery backup so far. Little bit heavy compared to my previous version. Face unlock feature is a bit irritating sometimes as it gets unlocked sometimes when u don’t wanna do it
CG,Well I’m writing this review after 3months of usage.
OR,"Writing this review after 1 week of usage. Purchased the 128 GB version during the freedom sale for 57k. I was confused between One plus 7 Pro, IPhone XS and the XR and I must admit that it turned out to be a good decision. Its a classy product and feels premium in hand compared to other devices in this price range. The features that the other phones boast about are hardly being used in day to day life unless you are an avid gamer. The screen size is just perfect and quality is not bad as being highlighted in some of the reviews on youtube. Battery life is excellent, camera is very good and the phone is waterproof. Performance is excellent with A12 Bionic processor."
OR,"I used to be an apple hater but no other phone ever matches the gaming optimisation of the iPhone XR/XS/XS Max. These devices with the A12 bionic chip just beat any other android devices in graphics rendering performance without a doubt. People have been complaining about the display that is basically 828p but trust me, you won’t even notice the difference between a proper 1080p screen and this one. In fact this screen looks better than most of the 1080p mobile phone screens (thanks to the liquid retina display technology it uses). The camera is amazing in all aspects and one of the best out there in the smartphone market but it can’t click portraits without detecting a human face (P.S. you can download an app named halide at the appstore to click non human portraits)."
CG,After 2 weeks of usages I am giving my review:
CG,Very good phone but can be priced better as this can be considered as low in value for money otherwise
OR,Best budget phone from Apple with better image stabilisation similar to iPhone XS. Battery life is extremely competitive with one plus battery's lifetime.
CG,One of the best iPhone ever. Features are fabulous and battery life is excellent. On an average it lasts up to 10 hrs if you are an extensive phone user. This includes data usage and voice calling.  Bit heavy I comparison to other iPhones or android phones but might be that’s the trick it’s good on battery life. I’ll give 10/10
OR,"The camera quality is not as good as I excepted it to be. It forms grams in the captures which is very evident when the pictures are projected on a monitor or a tv screen. Battery life is superb, goes more than 36 hours with normal usage until it hits the 20% low. Face recognition is perfect."
OR,"Everything else is quite well except battery consumption which does not lie with the promised service that is upto 25 hrs of talktime (wireless) and upto 16 hrs of video streaming (wireless), at all."
OR,"Hi, The device is good as it has everything what people look for in this price segment, i have used both i11 and XR , 11 is best because it has new processor rest XR is also a good option."
OR,"I have received this product  on 1 Jul 2019, Since then i am experiencing difficulty with wi-fi Connections (taking some time to connect, not connecting spontaneously, not detecting other Wi-fi connections). Face ID not working properly (taking time to detect).  I was thinking Amazon sold the one of the damaged product. Very  bad experience with such a costly mobile ordered in Amazone"
OR,"Got.the product today, heating up very fast , and also not connecting to Android and other equipment. Not performing when trying to upload to cloud, etc. Connectivity issues.  Amazon says no refund , am in the.process of cancelling other buy orders."
CG,"Was using X 64gb from last 2 yrs, apart from OLED display things are pretty much the same"
CG,Awesome...
OR,"iPhone XR is brilliant perfect value for money phone giving all the specs of latest iPhone in a reasonable price. Packs the same display, screen & pixel density as iPhone 11 only difference being camera upgrade & A 13 bionic processor rest almost everything is same. Excellent battery life, display in iPhone XR. The White Colour looks simple, sober & classy unlike dull creamy white in XS or XS Max last year. All in all a very good phone & thoroughly satisfied with it."
CG,This phone really feature-rich.
CG,Terrific Purchase. Initially there was a heating issue while updating software but it has gone now and working excellent.
OR,"Coming from iphone 8, i really didn't need this upgrade..but believe it or not..i am flattered..got a stellar deal of 40k for 128GB..camera is good from iphone 8..overall still it can't beat my other beast Samsung Galaxy S10 plus..but here is the cliche..an iphone is an iphone."
CG,I was worried that it will be little oversized with 6.1 inch but fits well . Battery backup is good one full charge keeps it running for 1.5 days . Not tested camera yet . Got it in very good deal at 46k . Blue colour looks good.
OR,"Third class screen and resolution, Very poor outdoor visiblity, network issue with dual sim, wifi drop/speed issue, slow data/ltr issue...slow charger included which takes ages for full charge..."
CG,I am writing review after two months of usage.
CG,Great battery life. We're getting a battery life of almost upto 2 days now.
OR,"I was skeptical at first. Some people mentioned that they received fake of defective products. In my case, the product is genuine. I checked it’s serial number on Apple website too. There is no difference in performance compared to people who bought from stores."
OR,What do I say about it. Night vision of camera is not at all good. Battery literally gets drain if we use mobile data for longer time. Yes but I have to admit if we do not use mobile data or wifi battery life is longer. Face recognition is not as fast as I was thinking compare to other brands with same features. But I loved my iPhone regardless of all this little issues.
OR,"All the performance is good with all working features. and the main point was the battery backup of the phone it will minimun 1 and 1/2 day and another amazing think is i got no heating in this phone while i playing games like pubg mobile,cwc2 etc.Also a measure think is there is no comparison of ios with android. IOS is best in his performance."
OR,"Overall its a good product, battery backup is little bit good compared to other iphone models.., Camera is Okay but i have seen mostly noise in the photos.Sound quality is as usual awesome, and I didn’t tried underwater test but tried splash test, it’s  up to the mark upon splash proof....I am using it since last 3 months I didn’t face any problem...Go 4 It👍🏻"
CG,Switched to iPhone XR from MI A2
OR,Amazon people are least bothered after giving a defective product.Such a costly product and i wonder how they can give such a defective Apple product and the customer has to run around with that.Amazon will ask to contact Apple support center and submit it there. and if you contact Apple customer care they will ask to contact Amazon. it just goes around like that.After submitting to Apple now amazon people are relectuent to take it back... its been 5 days without any solution...Please don't buy iphones from Amazon...Worst experience...
OR,Its been one week since i bought it. I am completely satisfied with the product. Screen is quite big. Only and only problem is with the Charger. It takes 3 hours to charge the phone to 100%. Otherwise everything else is worth the price we are paying.
OR,I bought this iPhone XR in the Great Indian Sale from Amazon. Product was perfectly delivered and on time. Buying from amazon is safe and you get genuine products always.
OR,Guys i wud suggest u all to not buy the phone from the site as the one I have received is nt in its best condition..it’s sensor is nt working properly n it hangs too at times n I have just received the phone just 15 days back
OR,I had never used an Iphone before and I was always sceptical about going for an IOS from android but after using this phone all I can say is IOS is on par with android.
OR,It is my red beast.... My first iPhone experience with iPhone xr is very smooth and awesome... I got is at only 38K many many thanks to amazon for this. Battery performance is good... with normal usage it gives around 24hrs backup while with heavy usage 12-13 hrs backup u can definitely get. But charging adapter  in the box is very pathetic. I just ordered an 12W fast charger at 1K from amazon. It is a smart choice to get iPhone Xr at 40K over iPhone 11 at 59 K (Including HDFC bank offer). With your saved money u can buy different apple accessories. Overall my first iPhone experience is awesome.
CG,This is my first iOS
CG,"Not even completed 1 yr of this product and price reduced drastically. How you can decrease the price to such extend. I need compensation for that, amazon shall take necessary actions on it."
CG,"got this for a superb deal, in fact way cheaper than mu prev 7plus which i got back in late 2016. Face ID works like a charm and the display seems great for normal usage."
OR,"After 5 days of use,Love the IPhone XR Red ,Premium Top Class Phone,Got it For 38 k...Worth it...Camera Is Classy and Superb...With depth Control feature....Very Smooth...Display is good...Bit Battery is little low but compared with other iPhone it is good....Battery Standby is 10 hr when onscreen time is 8h 30m with always Data on with usage of FB ,YouTube and other apps. Face Unlock is so quick..Over all love to have this IPhone XR...Upgraded from IPhone SE to XR...So Battery is very much better for me...🥳🙏🏻"
OR,"This is my first apple product purchase, prior my mentality regarding the apple product was like a no Value for money company, but once I started using this phone the premium fell and the Sooth buttery flow type interface is way better than android. Happy to use this phone."
OR,"Great phone. Not a gamer so don’t care about the hardware stuff. Not a pro photographer so any pictures I shoot are epic for me. Not a loud person, so speakers on low volume for me work just perfectly. Battery life should be great like most apple phones do. Display is soft to my eyes so I like that. Apple interface is the best, so nothing much to say about there."
OR,Used for a day as of now. Awesome phone. Snappy and fluid in use. battery backup is pretty good (around 8 hours of screen-on time) with continouse data-on (youtube 1.5 hrs). Using 18W adapter which charges it fast. Brought 3.5mm jack connector to lightening separately. Rest all good. Will review after few more days. Thanks.
OR,"I don't like the  features of iPhone XR after paying huge amount. It's battery is drained very fast . Side buttons are not comfortable while holding on hands, it pressed automatically without knowing . One-Two times it has automatically dialed the number when it was in my pocket. I think old version of iphones are  much better than this phone. I wants to return this phone but don't find any option in Amazon. Anyone please suggest how I can return it. I bought it 28 days before."
CG,There is no fingerprint reader on this phone as its replaced by face recognition which works fine. User interface is same as my earlier iPhone which is excellent. Coming to battery life...it is simply amazing.
OR,"Second time I shifted to Apple . But this time it was from One Plus 5T . Speed wise, battery wise, photo and video quality wise , fast charging , everything One Plus was better .  XR hangs also sometimes while receiving calls . But it was never the case with One plus ."
OR,"I received in original iPhone sealed package.  For its price, its best possible iPhone in market. Look and feel is great. Very fast responsive while using. Camera quality is 5-Star, Portrait pics are crisp clear. Watched some 4k and HDR videos on this iPhone, stunningly beautiful with tru color and deep contrast on this display. Its Amazing iphone, Thanks Amazon."
CG,This item is faulty. Make a sure first .
OR,Using this phone since last 20 days...first time iOS user...spending this much money not worth i have purchased @ 43000.00.purchased it because i have not used apple before...those who r buying it just because of Apple logo..pl don't go..those who r enthusiastic for technology must go for it...i m a simple user not very technical not very camera oriented...a simple redmi user..i m not saying phone is bad but doe those who don't have much usage with regards to its unique features should avoid this...
CG,Amazing
OR,"What is the main purpose of the Phone? To make and receive calls, right. This phone has a defective microphone so call quality is damn poor. You have to speak very close to the microphone for the other person to hear you. All other feature works quite well. As for photos, even Poco F1 takes better pictures. Applez just a brand as was Nokia and Blackberry once."
CG,After using one month best camera and battery backup.
CG,I browsed a lot about this phone all were saying it has a LCD display and which is older.
OR,"Serious problem with the lower mic, after spending all that money in this faulty crap just after two months you finally feel that you are the biggest C* in India who is buying an iPhone. Fragile product, connectivity issue, software issue & restrictions  all the type of minor issues have been build up causing a serious issue. Think before you waste ya hard earned money. Apple products are degrading their quality to keep their stocks and shares up."
CG,Good deal and worth buying for iPhone customers non iPhone user please don't buy as you will not find worthy but as a premium product its very good and feels better in hand superb quality
CG,Bought it In white 64gb variant...looks are premium and has a large screen...being an lcd screen it far much better than other phones in competition...u get about 56gb of usable storage which is quite ok for a minimal user...performance is amazing and camera quality is average...must buy if you are looking for a budget iphone specially on offers
OR,Well Apple products deliver quality and apple I phone xr is just another fine product I bought few days back which is their lowest model in iPhone x series. Well for the specs and lcd screen I really feel it's over priced that's reason it gets one star less.
OR,"Happy with the phone, initially I was scared to buy as it is expensive, and reviews were making me go on doubt, but the product came in a good condition,phone is superb. Thank you amazon for fast reliable service"
OR,"I am giving this review after few months of use of this phone. Apple never disappoints you. As i have shifted from Google phone to Apple, was bit difficult to shift from android to ios but now i am used to it. So many hidden features which u can find it out from you tube. Camera is awesome. I also learned some extra tips for photography from youtube and it is awesome. The speed of the phone never disappoints you after loading full 64gb data into the phone. Overall phone is awesome."
CG,It’s as good as buying from the store. The plastic cover which covers the box had a cut and small piece missing . Due to bad handling may be . That was disappointing to see. But then again the box was all sealed and it’s ok . Nothing to complain
CG,I was more satisfied with my one plus 6T than this. Picture customization is not better than that phone. Without comparison it's ok. Battery life is good than other iPhones and the app size in store is very less compared to play store so even with 64 gb it's good.
OR,This product is not adequate in terms of its quality & performance. It’s screen creates problems in eyes i.e. not comfortable for eyes. Very very bad product. Totally disappointing. Very very bad item delivered by Amazon. Heat problem is there with my iPhone XR. Amazon Sells fake iPhones. Not satisfied at all. This iPhone has also hanging problem.
OR,I like the XR. This review is more for people who have yet to graduate to buying mobiles etc online. This was my first time. I had heard all sorts of stuff. But Amazon THANK YOU! Delivered in a tamper proof packing! With the assurance of a ten day window to return. The phone is working just fine!
OR,"The accessories and the packing not at all good. I have used apple products, earlier packing and accessories are very good quality. Seems apple degraded the quality may be they have ordered from China. Not matching the standard of apple."
OR,Very bad experience in this iPhone XR. There are so many issues in this phone like when I click on airdrop icon then phone freezes and I have to force restart to get it working.
CG,"Quality at its best . You buy it and if you want QUALITY, with best user friendly interface and camera . List goes on . Its the best . That’s why u are here . Don’t think again and again . Click buy . You wont regret and yes u want it. 😉👍🏻"
CG,"Excellent choice from iPhone family , only sad they drop the price around 10k 2 months after my purchase. I missed the chance, lucky new customers."
CG,I used it for 1 month.
OR,I am very happy to this i phone xr mobile. Very good and very comfortable mobile for good battery health goood camera and good Processor proformence. No any mobile Completed to i phone . Very good privacy and ezy to use u must by
CG,This is my first iPhone. Though it’s too early to give any review about the phone  as I bought it recently but  till now I’m very impressed with iPhone XR. Go for it.
CG,"Well, it has been more than 2 months now and the phone has been getting compliments. It's the first iPhone that I've bought and I should say that the money you're paying for the phone is mostly for the brand image."
CG,"Can't believe I got this phone for Rs 36,000"
CG,I have bought it around a month back. Used it and then writing a review.
OR,3D camera not working .. cannot setup faceid .. always displaying Face ID not available error neither front camera portrait working .. please help don’t have a clue where to go for help
OR,The most positive aspect of XR is battery life in my usage of 6 months. Downside is weight especially if you are upgrading from iPhone 6 or 7. Quite heavy due to big battery. Make sure you upgrade to iOS 13 and use the feature to optimise battery charging for longevity of battery
OR,"I upgraded from iPhone 6 which I had used for 2.5 years. For me iPhone XR seems super smooth with amazing speed. I am still getting used to the absence of Home button. Using the regular charger, the phone takes nearly 2 hours to fully charge but charge lasts for more than 1 day for my regular usage. Phone is slippery - so I have added a Spigen case as well. On the whole a good iphone."
CG,"Amazing product, fell in love with IPhone.In short I can tell this product is dam equal to premium 48-64 mega pixel camera phones in market,even bit more.I got it for all time low price 38000/-"
OR,"Flawless product, really good product thanks Amazon received the perfect without any default or any. Mobile performance is awesome as I have upgraded from iPhone 6s to Xr feeling great and enjoying the new features face unlock and others. Face unlocking is very fast and quick compare to other android phone 5 ⭐️ from my side👍👍👌"
CG,The product was intact. Great packaging. The phone feels amazing. It’s my first time using an iPhone and I really think the XR is worth it if you want an iPhone that doesn’t burn a deep hole in your pocket.
OR,It’s my first iPhone and I am totally happy with it. One thing that iPhone XR is having a best battery backup. And I love the performance. I was having a Redmi Note 4 device previously. It was having a 4 GB ram but it’s performance was not up to the mark. I am surprised how iPhone is handling this kind of performance in only 3 GB of RAM 🤔
CG,Not happy with battery life. Rest everything Is fine.
OR,Just loving the XR and is super value for money. Camera quality is really good and screen size is just perfect for watching videos and doesn’t look bulky at all. Only downside is that the Apple logo at the back on the black colour isn’t visible to the naked eye so prominently. Best iPhone after the 6s model.
CG,"Not bulky, not big, this is a perfect sized iPhone. Display is crisp and clear. Smart hdr photos are great. It was a steal deal for me at Rs. 37999 during special sale. Delivered within 22 hours of ordering."
CG,"Got it for ₹37,999 and at this price it is the best phone. Though a little bulky and heavy but it’s fine."
OR,"Camera quality, battery life both are best features of the phone. No fingerprint sensors are drawbacks. Little bit heavy than OnePlus 5T. Never used LCD screen feeling odd for a while but it's worth for money. Built is very strong. iPhone comes with some unnecessary apps I will delete it later."
OR,Excellent camera and phone build. There is no finger print reader in this but Face ID is ur answer for all this. Works great and secure. Battery is super better when compared to older iPhones and lasts more then 24 hrs with calls music Bluetooth devices connected and browsing and social media. Pretty satisfied so far.
CG,"Overall Iphone XR is far better than X and other predecessors. Processor is way fast than others, build quality is awesome ,face recognition is too quick and the feel which you get by holding it is superlike. One suggestion to Apple that they must include fingerprint sensors too for more effective security."
OR,Bought it for 49999 on sale and it's totally worth it. I'm using iPhone for 1st time and totally in love with it. As iPhone is famous for its camera quality and it's true. Only problem is that it doesn't have the fingerprint lock.
CG,I’ve been using this phone since a week now and i must say its totally worth the money! Just go for it!
OR,"Device was heating too much after just a little bit of graphic works on that. Camera was too bad , front camera is no where matching the quality of IOS. I was totally disappointed with that device , I think they sold me the defective peice in the name of sale on your platform. This kind of professionalism is not good . I believe too much on Amazon but later on that I am not giving any bulk amount of order on this e commerce platform. Sorry for the comments if it hurts anyone."
CG,I bought 2 iPhone XR both are awesome. Can’t really say much the phone itself makes a statement.
CG,"I just loved it and I think the only thing that is lagging in this product which is the oled screen is not an issue at all , the quality of the lcd is way too good and as long as you are not too obsessed with every feature to be the latest and best , go for it , plus now they are offering at a way better price , definitely worth it"
OR,"Camera quality is good. 4/5 stars. Rear camera at night is awesome. It gives the effect of DSLR. Front camera is of average quality, grains when taken photo. But apple camera gives the natural effect to your photos!"
CG,It’s been about a month using the IPhone XR. Was too enthusiastic about buying this phone.
CG,"Front camera deteriorating everyday. Front camera quality is supper flop, even worst den any minimum range android phone. Rear camera is also not at per. Face detector not so good. No finger print available hence facing problems most of the time. Overall Apple releases a bad number with this variant."
OR,Got this for 38k and received within 2 day of placing order ....Apple FACE ID is the most secure way of unlocking your phone which you wouldn't get on an another phone...camera is also top notch and is the same camera which iphone XS has got  but without the 2nd  telephoto/wide angle lens....overall quite happy with the iphone xr.
OR,I upgraded from my iPhone 7 to XR and I’m really happy with the performance looks and all the new features. Battery life is awesome and face recognition works perfectly even in dark. Total value for money and it goes without saying as it is an Apple product.
CG,"I’m so happy to say, it’s an authentic/genuine Apple Product. Will definitely buy again. Amazon actually gives you better discounts than Resellers."
CG,"Received it yesterday, transferring data from my 7 plus took a couple of hours( maybe because of net issues) but everything on my old phone came on this XR. The camera is truly amazing. Go for it."
OR,"Excellent device.Value for money. I already have iPhone 11 . I bought this for my friend there is not a single difference when compared to iPhone 11. Phone display,performance,everything same as iPhone 11. I’m pretty much satisfied."
OR,"Liked display, camera quality, response etc. battery life is not great compared to 5000 mih Android phone. 18 hours from full charge."
OR,It’s price dropped to 39000+discounts within 20 days I purchased at 52000. It seemed to be cheated. A huge -ve impact for further purchases. Site as well as apple have to manage all things regarding it otherwise both will lose their credibility. No doubt product is good but these huge fluctuations in price ruined whole prospects of the product
OR,Has every thing you might be looking in an iPhone except the oled screen camera is as good as iPhone Xs with few limitations. If display is not a big concern for you you can't get a better phone than this at this price range.
CG,Amazing camera in bright light. Average to poor performance in medium and low light conditions. Great battery. Privacy protection is an understated advantage.
CG,"The iPhone XR delivers fast performance, great cameras and longer battery life than other flagship phones, all in a colorful and affordable package."
CG,"Everything is well checked and warranty looks legitimate. Absolutely genuine product without any doubt. Bought yellow colour, feels mango in my hand. Getting a worthy case is real challenge though."
OR,"After Using IPhone 6s & OnePlus 6, IPhone XR 128gb is juz awesome in face recognition battery life & user interface, Compared to IPhone 11 lesser in cost  both are in same size & same 4G !"
CG,Such a good iphone for such a great price.
CG,"Its just a phone with good features, if switching from android you will love using its interface, a pure secure platform and flawless running experience."
OR,"Excellent product, 100% original! I bought iPhone XR 128gb in the month of October, I was double minded to buy this product as all know online products will never reach us perfectly. But my assumption failed with this product."
CG,in one word I forgot android.. lovely phone
CG,"This phone is a beast. Man,the phones touch response is just awesome and iOS is so buttery smooth."
OR," This is my first apple device in terms of phone. The phone is totally worth it (every penny).  The colour, camera, design, sound quality everything is just way beyond perfection."
CG,Got It for 38k. Ditched One plus 7T for this and I am very happy with this decision and ya screen is great but you will feel difference if you are coming from 1440p display else it is great.
CG,"Great phone camera is good ,battery is good , but it take too much time to charge , company #APPLE need to give fast charger in box. And one more thing the weight of iphone xr is little bit more than other android phone.  Other wise phone is great.......gaming performance is great😘"
CG,"Just want to say GO FOR IT! I got it for 39,999 in the Amazon Great Indian festival and let me tell you, it arrived within 24 hours. Even though iPhone 11 is here, it has the same exact screen and almost the same features except the camera. If you are a die hard camera fan, then go for iPhone 11. But this works for me :)"
CG,Don't buy iPhone on amazon
OR,The phone which a person need this is one for them. Really loved it everything in this price range bybapple it is very good product. But i m not satisfied with its display. Display quality and clearity is very poor 720p video play is not good so blurry
OR,THANKS TO AMAZON GOT DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AT FIRST FOUND SCRATCHES AND DAMAGE BUT AMAZON ALWAYS THERE TO HELP YOU GOT REPLACED QUICKLY WITHIN FEW DAYS AND GOT A BRAND NEW PRODUCT LIKE TO THANK YOU AMAZON AND SELLER ALSO DARSHITA ELECTRONICS IF YOU ARE THINKING TO BUY IPHONE GO FOR DARSHITA❤️
OR,"camera quality is just awesome and battery backup is soo great that give you a whole day use, smooth interface,in many reviews they said display is of LCD, but when i got my device, then i Relies even that iphone have LCD display but it is great viewing display, I have no regrets to buy that iphone XR. Go for it guys."
CG,Nothing to say about iPhone it’s always the best phone. But this time i have to thank Amazon for bringing the cost down and affordable during great indian sale which says IRRESISTIBLE DEAL which really is a irresistible deal
CG,"iPhone XR is Good and I am yet to use all features of the phone, I had used iPhone 5, 6s. Lots new features available ."
OR,It’s a great phone. Cut some stars as the camera developed a problem after only 6 weeks. But Apple has fixed it. But it was unexpected and Apple and the seller must ensure that these things don’t happen
OR,"The phone conks off, don’t think the OS can take load. Been just 2 months and it’s already acting up. Not sure if the problem is with the device or orders from amazon."
CG,Display 4/5
OR,I always thought to buy iPhone and every time I used to think that what is so special in iPhone but yes after buying iPhone XR I can say that no one can replace this. Starting from battery life to the screen which is standard and can be used one handed. Camera quality is also very good which you can realise after two three clicks only. So for me iPhone XR is a beast at low price among other iPhone models.
CG,Camera not that great.
CG,ORDER PLACED : 1 October 2019
CG,"Pathetic product, everyday reporting new issues and going to hangout every time."
CG,"No questions about 🍎 other than its affordability, XR got a price cut and made it affordable. Overall product quality is awesome, only issue is at times its too hitech to understand."
CG,Apple ecosystem and almost latest specs for 40k.
OR,"I purchased this beauty in big billion sale. Thus I got it at a remarkable price. The battery life is good so far and the speed has been pretty good. I love the overall look, size and design of this model a lot. The camera quality is great but definitely the higher version have a better camera quality experience to provide."
OR,"I am iphone lover but always disappointed with battery back up. But after getting this superb phone my love towards iphone become more stronger. Amazing camera screen clarity, good time response, face unlock takes leasser than eye blink.amazing battery back up. Stunning look. Overall no need to purchase dslr camera. Spend money on it and u get phone for the lifetime."
OR,While so far all my iPhones before had a small write up about the licensing etc at the back of the phone. This XR does not have any writing.
OR,"Phone is excellent...Thanks to Amazon for their service. But the delivery was pathetic, the delivery boy refused to deliver the product. I, myself went to their office to get my phone. Hope that it will not repeat in future."
OR,The camera quality in night is awesome..there are lots of features to do edit the pictures and videos. Other than that battery life is around 1.5 days in normal usage and 6-8 hours in heavy games like pubg asphalt videos YouTube play music etc. at the price of 43k it’s a steal....
CG,"Received my iPhone within a week after place the order, Had issues with it but thanks to amazon for speedy replacement."
OR,"Using the XR for the past 3 months and I’m completely delighted to have this model. Certainly a value for money product in the iPhone flagship category. Battery life is excellent, charging for one time in a day itself will have enough power for the remaining day. Camera quality is comparatively better than the other high end categories iPhones."
OR,"Camera is very good .Screen size is just right for people like me who use phone for typing mails to watching Netflix .One can download multiple apps .Speed is good .Face recognition works like magic .Have been using iPhone since last 5 yrs ,and have found no reason to complain so far."
OR,"It's one of the best phones available in the market right now. Apple always gives the best products to its customers. It had A12 chipset which can do 5 trillion operations per second. It never slows down. It gives you the best phone using experience. Go for it, if you can buy it. Don't buy Samsung products or OnePlus products they are just useless. Just go for the product."
CG,Review after 5 months of usage approximately.
CG,#1mobile of the my devices

CG,could not find fingerprint reader. Otherwise camera and battery life are good. I like live camera in edit mode in camera.
OR,I have purchased this product during the diwali sale on Oct 22 and now the adaptor doesn't work. A product worth 43k having an adaptor life of 22 days... I don't even know what else to do now. Removed the sim and started using old broken phone since morning
CG,I am using iPhone from last 8 years. This model no need to carry power bank(for me) compared with iPhone 6s and 7

CG,There is nothing much to say specially about iPhone. I have used several android devices and I switched to iPhone XR from OnePlus 6. Simply this switching is fabulous experience to me.
OR,"Got it for 39000 in the great Indian sale along with exchange (redmi 4) and using SBI credit card. Anawesome phone. Once we use iPhone, android phones seem cheap.

CG,I have used iPhone since so many years

OR,"Awesome phone, great battery life it can last upto 2 whole days, face ID works great even if you are in dark room. Screen size perfect so that we can do tasks using single hand. Will get long term support. 5w charging adapter works well but it's good to have 12w charger than 5w."
CG,"Feel big for iPhone 7,8,6 users."

CG,I like this phone.
OR,"I got iphoneXR at very reasonable price. The apple company has made one thing better in this model i.e. battery life. The phone runs for 2days with full charge. there is no finger print reader in this model although face id is very accurate, it scans your face even in the dark. There is no doubt about the picture quality when it comes to iphone."
CG,I am big Apple fan from almost decade 😃and they have never disappointed either on the hardware side or the iOS( operating system). Got this from amazon deal at very attractive price
CG,It is really a good one by apple. Easy to use and very fast processor. I just love it... and big advantage is it supports dual sim but now the price has been dropped to 54990 by apple in india
OR,Ya really super phone/they’re confusing to(AirPods &Earpods) this phone with EarPods with lightening connector only not for Bluetooth AirPod ur clearly understand then u will pay

OR,After using it for 6 days properly . The phone started to hang it automatically restarts and gets stuck on apple log had to format my phone 2 time. Apple service center could not detect the problem . THEY Said it should be sent to bangalore for repair due to some motherboard issue . So i dnt want all that headache i want my phone replaced by a new sealed pack same iphone
CG,No lesser than iPhone XS Max
OR,"At Rs 35,000 (big billion sale + exchange offer), its a steal. For phone review, go to google - there are plenty of XR reviews. As good as it gets"
CG,"What a phone . Display is not a concern ,it's brilliant even it's 720p.build is excellent ."
CG,"It's a very pretty and good looking mobile. Performance wise, it is super smooth. Camera is as good as iPhone XS, portrait mode is also good enough.  And the best part is, being an iphone it has a long lasting battery. Though it has LCD, but you would hardly be able to find any difference between this and OLED. Size is perfect, infact everything is perfect and cool!"
OR,The phone is definitely not performing per iPhone standards - frequent Call drops ( the issue is not with network provider ) and battery life is worse than iPhone 8.
OR,"Back glass of Iphone got broken after one month of buying without any prior incident. Disappointed with the service provided by Amazon. If something happens to our product, Amazon will be saying to contact Manufacturer."
OR,"Face ID is very very slow. There seems to be a problem with the microphone. There is an issue with the sensors. Microphone issues, touch issues. I’ve been trying to raise a complaint but the amazon support team is always redirecting me to the apple website. I’ve been unable to return this item since I’ve discovered the problems. I really need assistance on this matter."
CG,Great phone = great battery life + great camera especially in low light + great security and face recognition. Very happy and bought it at the right time before the prices went up again.
CG,Like the luk and fallen in love on firstsight. Feel great when unlookers give an appreciative glance. Invaluable asset.
OR,"In portrait Camera - while taking a photo of a substance or anything (other than people)it always says ‘person not detected’. portrait function is only for people , not for the object."
OR,"What to say it’s Apple amazing man but when you’re buying this mobile better you should buy a CaseAlong with it because the backside of mobile is slippery and made of plastic plus glass,,Worth to buy it"

OR,I just love it.it has got all I want.good camera decent battery life good sound etc etc.and the display do not give me any problems.if there is something to complain about it is the price.

OR,Best value for money in iphone . I am extremely satisfied with the purchase with no worry for storage for this 256 GB model. Wireless charging is just wow.
CG,"Its a perfect phone, though a bit heavy coz of the metal body. I got this in red colour which is my favourite and its such a settled red, basically its a mixture of red and maroon. Camera quality is also good not the best as compare to other apple phones. Overall i love my phone as its a gift from my darling husband."
CG,Timely delivered. Gr8 deal from amazon. Few months back I ordered one plus mobile from same seller. They delivered original product.
CG,Simply love XR! Battery life is great and I’m not really missing the telephoto lens! Do buy product red as it support AIDS Research.
CG,The product is working fine. Just as expected from apple product. However there were two scratch marks on the sides of the phone just after unboxing which is very strange
CG,It’s always a charm to use iPhone. Ease of use and fast response are key.
CG,This phone is hanging n seller is not returning or changing this phone I tried many times but
OR,"I have been an apple patron for a while.. I Started using the Iphone 3, 5, 6, 7 and now i bought the XR.. I honestly feel that its terrible.. Just a hype build around it.. The Face ID never works, the camera gets stuck on its portrait mode.. My honest feedback is not to but the iPhones anymore. Just will have to say that Apple lost itself a good customer.."
CG,"Excellent phone I am happy I suggest u all to buy with amazon, because maintaining genuine sellers with good quality products and the biggest most important  thing is  customers support I am very much happy with amazon and their customers support. Hats off"
CG,I bought a new iPhone XR from amazon and the delivery was within 24 hours. It was a brand new pack sealed.
CG,"While I started using this phone, I realized that my takes much longer time to get charged. However, other phones I have get charged quickly from their respective cables. I am unsure about the originality of the product received."
CG,Not a value for money product.Apple is still giving 1amp charger with such expensive phone with almost 3000 mAh battery. The same charger is also  given along with 5s and also SE.
CG,"Bought this cell phone for my retired father. He is a person who wanted a great battery life, good camera and great speakers with ease of use that is not present in any android cell phone in the market."
OR,I have got the product in one piece that’s true but this product is defected one. Out of two speakers one is damaged. I am regulars IPhone user since from past 5 years and that’s why I could point it out. Amazon - kindly notice

CG,Excellent-The best we can purchase with small amounts purchased for 42999/- at offer from amazon
CG,Osome product but I suggest get iPhone 11 updated version of iPhone XR.
CG,Beautiful phone. Great camera. I just feel that the phone gets heated a bit I guess I am not sure though as it’s my first day on this phone and have been constantly playing online games
CG,Value of money is excellent but little costly
OR,evrything is good.problem compared with mi poco f1 Rs15000.waste of money..
CG,"I love apple products, have been using them since 2009 and this is the finest iPhone I’ve ever used."
OR,"I received my order yesterday and the voice recorder is defective, have spoken to apple support, after troubleshooting they recommended I get it checked at an authorised service centre as it seems to be a defected piece."
CG,"I bought this phone on Big billion day. It was well packed and the phone is very good. Battery quality and camera quality is  amazing. Those who do not buy yet and thinking for it, go for it, it will not disappoint you."
CG,"Size is bit over, good battery life than previous products. If you were using iPhone 6,6s or 7 might find it bigger to hold because it’s size is 6.1 which quite big for iPhone if you never used plus editions."
OR,Faulty charging cable it charges phone only from one side. When buying online check every aspect before actually using it
OR,The phone I received was defective. Please think twice about buying apple products as I faced the same issue with my MacBook Air. There is no solution provided by Amazon which was surprising as they use to have very good customer care. I feel I have wasted my money.
CG,The processor is not that speed as expected.
OR,Just received the phone and checked for the warranty on apple site. It’s showing that purchase is not validated...after 4 hours again I checked. And smile on my face. Apple said your purchase is validated and warranty

CG,I personally like Apple product. But my charger is not as good as it shout be like an apple product. After a moth of using my charger stopped working.
OR,Overall the phone rates 4/5 considering the price of 49k for a128 GB. Camera quality is gud but just has the basic features and no advanced techs like the ones in oppo /Mi .Battery is gud .It will sustain a day for me (I don’t play games).Call function is what worries me in this phone.It gets stuck all of a sudden while attempting a call.
CG,"First off all I would like say, the delivery boy of amazon is very polite with consumers."
CG,Faceid not functioning after 15 days.phone freezes once selfie portrait mode is activated.Face it does not work anymore now
CG,Android no match to iOS.
CG,"A gift for spouse, a bit on bulky side but an effective gadget"
OR,I've been using this phone for almost a month a now and this is the fastest smartphone I've ever used. I know this years iPhone 11 is faster than this but after watching a tons of comparison videos on YouTube I've decided to go with the XR. I don't think it's worth the extra bucks and I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
OR,Amazing smartphone with best build auality and camera have amazing pictures and battery life is also good but only one problem back single camera after all money value product
CG,Before buying this product i was so scared that what if the product is fake or may be used.
OR,We bought the phone during sale period near Diwali. Its nice phone with big screen. Ideal for people who reply to emails or do a lot of work related chat on the phone. Batter life seems to be really impressive. It goes without charging for 1.5 days with constant internet connection.
CG,"The phone had a software problem, the microphone wasnt working."
CG,WoW experience
CG,"This is clear update for me after iPhone 7. Camera quality is awesome. But the most impressive thing is battery life , it was seamless. You could miss 3D Touch but it’s ok ."

CG,Bought it during the second great indian sale for 41k. Though 3k higher than the 1st sale I am very happy to buy it as I know it’s a good deal. I am very much statisfied with the phone quality and delivery speed. But the packing quality should improve.
CG,"In fact, the features and functions of this mobile are very good, especially the price is very low, which is 39 thousand only, and the mobile was delivered in a very short time, it is now priced at 45 thousand,"
OR,An excellent phone. Does what you need at super speeds. Face ID is a charm. I think I got an excellent deal in the Dussehra sale. Only thing which has dumbfounded me is the colour. Looks orange on screen and more pinkish in real life. Solved using a Spigen black cover.  Should have gone for black.
OR,Received mobile through amazon while buying new set it self speaker 🔊 problem still not received any feedback from amazon they  just sold the mobile not taking responsibility feel very bad. There is poor customer support since the amount of I phone XR 📱 Rs. 45k very huge.
CG,"Have been using this fone since almost 1month, its simply adorable and a beauty (red colour)..camera quality is awesome, battery could have been improved a bit(16-18 hrs on full net usage).."

CG,"I am very frequent user of Internet data, but IPhone XR battery is awesome. It long-standing two days. And camera qualities is also awesome. It’s value to money."
OR,Not completely satisfied with the product as the dual sim on iphone is way too complicated. Battery and camera features is the best of XR.
OR,"I am facing difficulty in disconnecting / hang up the call, when I remove the phone from my ears, the lights didn’t appear so that I can disconnect the call I need to wait for other person to disconnect the call from their end because there is no light on the screen.

OR,"The phone is good don’t had any issues,but in box contents they wrote EarPods and gave normal earphones which is wrong information...they wil not give anything even sim card placement pin also"
CG,As the mobile is cool and fast performance and the interface is amazing as it is apple it feel the same all things are went good but only one bad thing its display as it is 720p display but slightly colour variable can be noticed but tho its good mobile at good price in apple
CG,A big change for me was moving up from iPhone 7 Plus to this phone is the Face ID. It is super fast and very accurate.
CG,"If you are buying just because of the brand name then go for it, else it's of no use."
OR,"Upgrading from iPhone 6 (16GB) to iPhone XR (128) was the best decision I ever made. Everything is so perfect & optimize. Touch, display, camera, sound, processor, battery.. literally everything.  Apple needs to work on their latest iOS 13 though. (Also I’m getting more kills on PUGB:) Hands down to A12 Bionic."
CG,Excellent iPhone in that too 40k. Camera battery and touch is Incomparable .
OR,"128GB variant ,Used it for a month,Great performance. Excellent finishing and stylish. Face ID is powerful as it works even in pitch dark conditions. Camera is amazing . A bit bulky when u put a cover as the rear camera is significantly above the back surface of the phone."
CG,I got a different item
OR,"This rating is only for the product not for  Delivery.  Till the last minute I was kept on my toes. The box was not completely in a sealed condition. Can Amazon answer for this? Coming to  Handset, No issues at all. It is simply amazing. One should know how to use it wisely. I would update my reviews after using it for few months."

CG,"Finger print sensor is missing , the phone is bit heavy"
CG,Good Priduct

CG,"Battery, camera, face ID and everything works well. Slightly heavy and bigger, if you are not used to use large screen phones, but use will soon get used to it"
CG,"Needless to rate Apple any less. An year old Apple’s A12 bionic still outperforms SD 855. And iOS, such a beautiful liquid smooth OS that Android can never compete."

OR,We went to Marmaris with my wife for a holiday. We chose this restaurant as a place for dinner based on the reviews and because we wanted juicy food. When we first went there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place..
OR,During my holiday in Marmaris we ate here to fit the food. It's really good that the food is cheap and nice. Eating as much bread as you want is a big plus for those who are not satisfied without bread. It is a place that I can recommend to those who will go to Marmaris. On July 1 there was a small increase but even the price hike is cheap. I leave the photo of the latest prices and breakfast below. there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place..
CG,Prices are very affordable. The menu in the photo cost 108 liras. You have to wait 10-15 minutes for food. Staff is annoying. Well it tastes good. Boiled meat was delicious.
CG,Turkey's cheapest artisan restaurant and its food is delicious!
CG,I don't know what you will look for in terms of price performance point; taste; but yigit restaurant writes a big plus for those who come to work in this region.
CG,Generally good.
CG,What you see is 125 TL in total. It's a pretty convenient place. We can say that it is an artisan restaurant; you should not expect a restaurant; but they are still quite good in terms of price and performance. As of July 1; prices will increase
CG,Delicious food at rock bottom prices. Friendly staff; Highly recommend
CG,"Every time I go, I still experience the amazement I experienced years ago as if it were the first time. There is no need to explain. Folk hero is a business."
CG,The most f/p of all businesses I've seen.
OR,The food was just like the ones my mother made. Prices were reasonable.
OR,The ambiance of the place is nice; when we went; there was a lot of queue; and after waiting for a while; they took our place. The friend who took our order said half a half pizza and we preferred half chicken and half steak. Two people were easily satisfied; a lot of patterns.
OR,"Flavor : It has nothing but dough taste. Labor : Not befitting a touristic place. Service : There was no wet wipes and napkins on the table, but there was no sympathetic family to say. This service and this taste were not available at this price."
CG,It is in the center; easy to reach; close to the parking lot; the prices are partially affordable; the products are delicious but not quite satisfying; the seating places are cramped; the place is a little flat.
OR,They make delicious pizza with nice ingredients on thin dough. Slice pizza and all pizza options are available. You can try two different flavors as a whole by making two different choices for the whole pizza. We wanted the mushroom and sausage. It was very nice; warm; and it was cooked in its consistency without drying the ingredients.
CG,It's in a nice place but it's very small and their pizza is not that good to be exaggerated. Pizza dough is nice and thin. They do not offer advice to the customer.
CG,I strongly recommend. If I come to the taste part; it was very enjoyable to eat with their special sauces. Also the whole pizza was huge.
OR,It is very tasty; similar to Italian pizzas. Roast beef and mohair 180 TL; other pizzas 150 TL. An adult male eats 6 slices; pizzas are one size and 8 slices.
CG,Do not come around Marmaris and do not leave without eating pizza at Pizza Fellas. We ate mixed pizza; they can make two types of pizza. So delicious!
CG,I never thought that the best pizza I've ever eaten would be in Akyaka. Thin pizzas are very tasty and the options are very good. We recommend it to everyone who comes to Akyaka.
CG,It was as if a very delicious Italian chef had come out of his hands. You can eat with pleasure. The owners are very good people. I recommend.
CG,The pizza is big enough for 2 people. The dough is very thin. Price is between 120-140 TL.
OR,The environment; the interest and friendliness of the employees; the taste is incredible. It is so beautiful inside that you do not prefer to sit at the bottom of the sea. Depending on the day; there are also things that are not written on the menu; be sure to check it out. Hours have passed since the meal; we are still talking about the beef brisket.
CG,Without any taste how they are at the first rank!!!! We ate cafe Inn pizza. It was 70 tl.
CG,Pizza is delicious.. I can say it is one of the rare tastes. Prices are in the 200-300 range and one pizza is more than enough for two people if you are not very hungry. The scenery is already gorgeous.
CG,The vegan breakfast made me extremely happy. It was nice.
CG,Whatever we ate was good. The Italian Restaurant is the first thing that comes to mind; apart from pizza and pasta; ciger yahni was successful; purslane salad; presentations are successful. Taste point in Datca.
CG,Very enjoyable beautiful place. Pizza salad food taste is great.
CG,Its breakfast is more satisfying than the places around it.
CG,Nice intimate restaurant. Good service. Eye for detail. Clean. Really good food; well presented.
CG,The food is delicious but a little pricey. The best Cappucino in Datça is here..
CG,It's a very delicious; beautiful small business; but the appointment is a bit difficult to find; the pizzas are great Cafe Inn pizza and a wonderful 4 cheese and brownie as dessert. Thank you for your good wishes.
CG,When I went; I waited for almost 20 minutes for the waiters to take care of me. The taste was not bad. The surrounding was beautiful.
CG,"It is a very, very expensive place. It took 30 minutes for 2 drinks to arrive."
CG,I had the creamy chicken vegetable stew. It tasted excellent. It was quite satisfying. The environment is beautiful and spacious.
CG,quality service and rich menu. the attitude of the staff is really excellent. A business that deserves 5 stars.
CG,The sushi was too small so it was not possible to taste the ingredients; the rice was overcooked and lacked flavor; it was missing except for the tail of the shrimp.
CG,The staff was very engaged. Service and taste were perfect.
CG,Perfect location next to the sea. Music; light in the evening lounge atmosphere. In short; everything is beautiful.
OR,"It was very expensive, but taste wasn't bad."
CG,Good quality service; nice customer service; they are happy to help with a smile.
CG,Scrambled eggs with casserole and toast waited 30 minutes. At 12:30pm the main menu was denied and showed only breakfast available. Prices are much higher than other places.
CG,"Nice view, good staff, clean place and nice atmosphere."
CG,Nice food and good service; located just near the beach as well.
CG,It was very nice to be greeted with a smile when we first entered; we went with my wife; the services are very fast; the empty services are removed immediately; the washbasins were hygienic and clean; and I would recommend a very reasonable place.
CG,Kebabs are good; trotters are good; desserts are good. Actually; the decor part of the atmosphere is good. Only a lot of noise comes from the kitchen part. Employees are smiling.
CG,If you come to Antep; sit down and taste the Beyran soup; served plain and with garlic.
CG,I asked for garlic; but I had a hard time getting the taste of the meat from the garlic flavor. I'll try again with little or no garlic. Quite satisfying. I like the taste too; you should definitely try it.
CG,Taste was amazing! Price was not high.
OR,When I ate it in the past; it tasted very good; I think the chef has changed. The atmosphere was average.
CG,We were very satisfied. I strongly recommend trying it. Delicious appetizers come with the meals.
CG,The food tastes good. The atmosphere of the place was not very attractive.
CG,We ate 1 mumbar and 1 kusleme and paid 310 TL. The meals were very tasty.
CG,Very cheap and delicious!
OR,Ayran came when the meal was over; the food was very bitter.
CG,Although the prices are a little high; the quality is high so it does not disappoint. The taste was very good; well done!
CG,We ordered Etli Ali Nazik Kebab. They said he was the most famous. We ate meat with yogurt. The food was cold.
CG,We came because it is a very famous place. They had really delicious food.
CG,Ali nazik was 240 tl lahmacun 50 tl even tea with a fee of 5 tl. We visited so many places; this was the most expensive.
CG,The taste was very good but the prices were also very high.
CG,Located in Gaziantep historical bazaar; the place stands out with its beautiful and spacious ambiance. I liked the place very much; we came for dessert after dinner.
CG,I had the chance to taste many flavors; all of them were very good; I was amazed by Ali Nazik Kebab.
CG,The restaurant that made our four-day Gaziantep holiday poison! There is already excessive noise; it is impossible to hear the person next to you. The waiters are indifferent; the order takes too long to arrive.
CG,"They sold us rotten pistachios, it sucks!"
CG,I don't know why we ate here despite the exorbitant prices. A portion of kebab or sis meat product starts from 220 TL as of the end of June 2023. Naturally; you expect a good portion; but a tiny portion in the middle of the plate.
OR,"A great business that does not compromise on its taste; lahmacun, garlic kebab; yoghurt kebab; the smile of the waiters; everything is in place; thank you very much for the nice service and delicious food."
CG,The breakfast was very good; I recommend it; the presentations were also eye-catching. We paid 240tl for the table you see in the photo; including 6 teas and 2 Turkish coffees.
CG,The place is beautiful. The staff was very nice. We asked for tiramisu. It was very fresh and beautiful.
CG,Beautiful place. The breakfast is said to be good. I had tea in the evening; it was delicious. It tastes like a samovar. The environment is calm. The music is jazz style; suitable for the calm and soft atmosphere.
CG,Hookah and ambiance is super!
CG,They have a problem with the service; but if you're going to drink tea; they do it well. Your tea is always hot over the fire.
CG,Some of the coffee I wanted came spilled; the coffee tasted dry. Also; my wife's order was wrong.
CG,Great.
OR,Lovely; affordable seafront spot to while away the afternoon smoking nargile and playing backgammon (tavla). Super hospitable employees and enjoyable ambience.
CG,A cheap and delicious place. If you are passing by; you should not continue without having a cup of tea.
CG,Seaside great view!
CG,Prices are nice
OR,Bitter; mango; Bodrum tangerine; honey almond; Big Babas; mastic gum; walnut; blackberry and forest fruit definitely recommend..
OR,The prices are cheap from the center; the ice cream is legendary; don't miss out; it's worth waiting in line; it's the best ice cream shop in Fethiye. Real milk ice cream
CG,Absolutely perfect come try it..
OR,Terrible. This is a lie. This is not ice cream! This gum is an ice cream substitute.
CG,As I was crossing the road; I noticed that we stopped. The light ad is very good because everything has ice cream icons. The only normal price I've seen in Fethiye is 6 TL.
CG,The atmosphere of the place was nice; if you want to taste the ice creams; I can say that it is an ordinary ice cream that you can eat anywhere.
CG,It literally gave me the feeling of chewing sugar. It's not even about ice cream.
CG,We visited with my friends. The lemon one was great!
CG,A great taste. I went on recommendation; it was really true. I also recommend it to you.
CG,Their prices are very reasonable and their ice creams are delicious. There is not only ice cream but also dessert sales inside. There are many options for ice cream; which is a very nice detail.
CG,On the way to the city center of Fethiye; a sweet place caught our attention. The ice cream cone-shaped totem on the road was very original.
CG,The hamburger bread was very nice. I didn't like his meatballs very much.Orders are coming out very quickly; and the working friends are very kind; thank you.
CG,A place that makes unorthodox burgers in Samsun. The hamburger bread is big and wide with lots of sesame seeds.
CG,It's a very nice place; the hamburger is very nice. The staff is very good; there is a children's playground
OR,The place is nice; the waiters work sulkily. The location; service and presentation are beautiful. And his hamburger might be the most mediocre hamburger I've ever had. There is no meat taste in the meatball.
OR,Mushroom burger the meat stays thin inside the huge burger bread; and the meat and mushrooms do not stay in the bread because of the sauce applied on the bread.
CG,They have really saturated menus. The prices are very good; and as a place with a very nice interior and exterior decor with sea views; I would definitely recommend it at the same time.
CG,I never liked the service very bad; when we brought the wrong burger and returned it; we had to wait that much longer. The potatoes were terrible; the only onion rings and mushrooms were beautiful. I will never go to this place again.
OR,The burger is successful; but the service is very slow; I came to the place 2 times; they bring the order incorrectly.
CG,The menu content is beautifully varied and satisfying.
CG,The price was not right; I bought a 2-piece menu; the burger and bread did not taste good.
CG,The prices were generally reasonable; the tastes were also good enough.
OR,The menus offered by the friendly staff are something else; the flavors we have tasted.
OR,"I would like to thank the service in Fethiye branch and especially Mr. Samet; the official here, for his interest and relevance."
CG,The menu is incomplete; not much; usually a disaster with happy sweet toys; felt-tip pens and a few cardboard coloring pages.
CG,Taste is exactly the same as in classic hamburgers; prices are extra high.
OR,Every time I come to Fethiye; I stop by and fill my stomach with pleasure.
CG,In general; everything was good; but the tables were not collected during the 35-45 minutes I was there. It was messy inside.
CG,The ambiance of the place looks a bit old.
CG,They are very fast and the food tastes good too.
CG,The potatoes were almost dead and tasteless.
CG,I didn't like the gloomy; dark atmosphere of the environment; the toilets are dirty; you are disgusted to wash your hands.
CG,There was a hair in the fries; disgusting.
OR,In terms of price; it is above Marmaris prices. In other words; there are menus with prices above the average. I was satisfied with almost everything I ate and drank.
CG,It is a place where the food is as amazing as the cocktails. The sole fish was very good. employees are very engaged.
OR,"Slagethi all nero was excellent. Beef ribs were always tender enough. Cheek, on the other hand; has preserved its taste even though its collection is a little small. If deterioration was to come; the services were passed and the environment was much expected."
CG,As we were passing on the road; it was pleasing to our eyes and we dived in. It was good overall.
CG,For people living in Marmaris; it is a beautiful place to visit in summer and winter. I recommend you to try liver because they serve it in a way I have never tried before and because of its amazing taste.
CG,Wonderful place where you can go with your family and have fun; nice place with live music...
CG,Prices were slightly higher than peers.
OR,Pukka is a restaurant by the sea where you will have the most beautiful pictures and videos where you can organize a nice organization in Marmaris.
CG,Great concept and very tasty food.
CG,Popular place for Winter and Summer; food and drink menu wide enough and delicious.
CG,Delicious. However; prices are as high as Marmaris in general in 2021.
CG,The interior design is simple and pleasant; with balconies and upper floors with sea views.
CG,"I can say that my worst flat white experience. ""Would you like milk?"" they said. I drank more milk than coffee."
OR,A great starbucks branch located in Bodrum center / bazaar / port. It's great because the layout; the environment; the place and the service are very successful.
OR,The place is very narrow; I can say it's the worst starbucks I've ever seen.
CG,It was a pleasant snack; a refreshing drink in hot weather.
CG,"The view is super, the cleanliness is bad, the location is very good"
CG,The place is so sweet. but it gets too crowded in the evenings.
CG,Familiar coffee that I taste
CG,Had to stop by for a take out coffee during the morning hours.
CG,Employees are very warm. in a very pleasant location.
CG,The employees are very good and caring. Best Starbucks..
CG,Here you can find by far the best 4-cheese pizza you can eat in Bodrum. On top of that; you may have reasons to come back again and again with the unusual taste and presentation of the magnolia.
OR,A place we found by chance during the winter season. First of all; we sat down to drink coffee and the environment was so spacious and calm that I was able to hold a meeting that I had to do over the web without any problems.
CG,I have never seen a pizza with such a thin pizza dough that the material did not fall apart. Pizza mista is a great choice for mixed lovers.
CG,It is a very nice place to watch the matches; when it is closed in winter.
CG,A pleasant place with a beach; delicious food
CG,It is a place where you can both enter at home and spend time with pleasure and eat and drink. The beach is very beautiful; your sea is clean. The food is also very good.
OR,It is a business that serves 2 orange juices that are not on the breakfast menu and that I did not order; as if they were on the menu; and charges an extra 40 TL.
CG,We sat at the table; 10m away from the water; went for a swim and then came back to our table. They have changing cabins inside; very clean. Tried some cocktails and they were really good; but prices are like in Kos; Greece where we came from.
CG,It is a restaurant-bar with an extraordinary ambiance. It has an excellent location on Bodrum Beach. The service is top notch and leaves nothing to be desired.
CG,Seaside; pleasant place; mediocre food; owners concerned.
CG,Beautifully located restaurant on the beach; very nice staff and very good value for money; would gladly come again.
CG,Nice place with a view. Not bad in terms of food but ordinary.
CG,A place where you pay for the view. In general; although the breakfast is good; 80tl per person for two people 160tl is a bit high.
OR,It has a location by the sea; a layout that allows for indoor and outdoor seating. Their waiters are nervous and sometimes indifferent.
CG,It was very nice that the food was delicious; the place was facing the beauty of Alanya Castle and especially all the staff were interested.
CG,Good salep was good; the employees were smiling..
CG,Food was tasteless. The waiters were not smiling at all.
CG,We wanted mint lemonade; they put mint syrup in the lemonade; when we asked; they said that's what we do; but if you don't like it; we'll change it and they changed it.
CG,A large spacious place. If you want; you can relax inside and have something to drink.
CG,Location is nice. We love it as a family. Pizza was delicious.
CG,Stylish; decent and clean place. I advise.
CG,In a beautiful location by the sea; sometimes it gets very crowded; the service can be delayed
CG,I think it came with a change in taste with the price update.
CG,It's nice; but it's very late. I place an order; it arrives an hour later; I would be happy if it was a little faster.
CG,A delicious doner.
CG,the ambiance was nice.
CG,Interest was good; but doner was a complete disaster. First of all; it came cold; there was no proper sauce in it; there was so much onion that I could not taste the meat at all.
CG,Awesomeee
CG,"Delicious doner. I went there with my friend, that was she's first. She liked too."
CG,"Nice place, good price; good quality"
CG,Delicious!
CG,It was one of the best doner I've ever eaten in my life. Thank you very much.
CG,There were problems with cleaning. Chefs must wear gloves.
CG,The atmosphere is very nice; the flavors are also very good; but the prices are a bit high.
CG,We went for breakfast in the morning; the atmosphere is nice. breakfast items were good and tasty.
CG,The cafe was cheap enough; I ate with my family.
CG,We ordered breakfast; the table was full. It was truly fascinating. I advise.
CG,The indoor atmosphere was nice; but I can't say the same for the outdoor
CG,We were very satisfied from the staff to the meal.
CG,Ambiance was good.
CG,Clean business; I liked it.
CG,They didn't care about us when we went.
CG,The restaurant is well located and above all it is nicely decorated and clean.
CG,Good quality drinks and food.
CG,Good location; no parking problem. The business is a little small. The products are considered good.. I didn't like the Sakarası dessert very much. Meat skewer and knife were not bad. Prices are normal..
CG,Employees are kind. Food is delicious
CG,The okra soup was hot and scrumptious to the broth. The meat loaf and tandoori kebab were excellent. We ate in the garden with pleasure in a cool weather.
CG,One of my favorite places in Konya in terms of service; hygiene and taste.
CG,It is one of the rare places where I can taste the Etli Ekmek I ate in my childhood.
CG,My wife and I liked the meat loaf very well; as the distance between the knives is very good. The downside was that there weren't enough toilets; we waited in line.
OR,I had heard that meatloaf was good; but the taste was not that praiseworthy.
CG,The food is delicious; but the portions are very small and the prices are so high.
CG,Waiters were better than Meram branch. Although the taste of Etliekmek is not very good; you can easily bring your guests from outside the city.
CG,Prices are high; even for the yogurt we didn't order; we were charged.
CG,Service is very slow. The ayran comes in advance; neither foam remains nor we saw here for the first time that buttermilk is paid.
CG,The atmosphere of the place and the interest of the waiters were good. Food came fast and hot. We ordered spicy tabokki; it wasn't bitter; it tasted very good. We ordered cheese kimbab and it had cheddar in it. I don't recommend it to those who don't like seaweed.
CG,"Atmosphere of the restourant was amazing, I felt times that I in Korea"
CG,The products were delicious; the service was fast; the employees were smiling and interested. Bulgogi mildly spiced meat was delicious.
CG,We had very high expectations; but unfortunately we did not like it. Chicken was very sweet. Prices are not too high. You wait in line outside.
OR,It was really nice; I liked it very much. Moreover; the prices are quite normal. Well done to everyone who worked there.
CG,Kimbap wasn't for me; it's a tough flavor.
CG,I don't know much about Korean cuisine; but I have tasted it. Chicken with soy sauce was cooked to a great consistency and served warm.
CG,I had been to a different Korean restaurant before; the ambiance there really made me feel like I was in Korea. I couldn't feel that feeling here.
CG,foods are good. but the environment and service is not a full korean experience.
CG,Super taste; best rose rabokki I've ever eaten in my life. At the same time; we ordered a gimbap with kimchi; and we think it suits them very well.
CG,A nice place where you can taste examples of Korean cuisine. The closest taste to Turkish cuisine on the menu. Traditional chicken. Prices are very reasonable.
CG,The flavor that I ate as a child is here; but there were many queues; as in all parts of Istanbul.
OR,Patso starts from 50tl. It comes with lots of potatoes in the bread wrapped in paper; dipped in ketchup or mayonnaise according to your needs. You have to eat standing up. It does not have a special flavor; but it is satisfying
CG,There was no place to sit and eat; we ate standing. It tasted good.
CG,I have never eaten such a delicious patso until now. Recommended guys. And I went again and I will continue to go again.
OR,I ate the big patso with sausage and cheddar; the potatoes are absolutely incomparable with the frozen flavorless potatoes of many places today. It is a perfect form of sausage bread; potatoes and cheddar blended with sauce; and it is satisfying.
CG,We ate the classic patso burger. In other words; french fries between fresh sandwich bread; ketchup mayonnaise on top. It tasted very good. No seating; we went to the park right next door and ate there.
CG,Prices are not real; we thought it was a camera joke.
CG,"It was very crowded, We wait while we're hungry!"
CG,Crispy on the outside; soft on the inside. It's always hot; it's a little crowded; there's no place to sit.
CG,I tried the large patso with sausage and cheddar. It was delicious and fresh. You can try.
CG,Great patso!
CG,160-year-old Vefa Bozacisi has not lost its flavor. We can find filled bottles in many places; but it's different to come here and drink. It's definitely fresher to drink on the spot.Vefa Bozacısı
CG,It was very nice to taste the boza in the historical place. Way better than other bozas.
CG,A historical place intertwined with history. The business is clean and tidy. The staff is very caring.
CG,Boza's are beautiful. The ones on sale are also freshly filled and prepared. It looks clean; but I don't know the exact details.
OR,Same taste for years. Its historical texture is another beautiful place.
CG,The taste is very good; and you can buy some roasted chickpeas; and it will be very high. Employees should be smiling.
CG,The number of tables is very small; but no problem; the taste was very good.
CG,Perfect!
OR,I don't understand what kind of business it is to sell boza in a foam glass. Offering chickpeas is a tradition next to the spoiler; but in Vefa you have to go and buy it yourself from the shop on the opposite side.
CG,Vefa Bozacisi must be the most beautiful place that comes to mind when Boza is mentioned. The groceries are quite affordable.
OR,It is a flavor that can be tried when you go to Istanbul.
CG,It is not p/p. Doner came cold and that's why it was hard.
CG,Eating with this view... It was legendary!
CG,There is a place to eat fish and bread across the beautiful place. If the weather is nice; we go to this doner shop; if not there. You can try.
CG,They deserve the stars more than enough for their service; hygiene and view; but if we talk about the food; I can say that it was the most delicious in a one-week Istanbul trip without exaggeration.
OR,Different from the price on the menu Price has been applied doner is dry and hard.
CG,A taste that hasn't changed for years with its legendary view and taste!
CG,You can go even for the view... The interest is very beautiful.. Those who want to eat meat (Halal food) should definitely stop by..
CG,We finished Iskender and Doner Burger with difficulty two weeks ago; we couldn't start the dessert part because there was no appetite for tail fat.
CG,Great.
CG,Ambiance was amazing!
CG,I think they make very good doner kebabs. We did not have any problems with the service. We parted happily as a family. As for the price; I think such a place has a very good tariff for such a view.
CG,"When we asked for a hamburger, we were told that it was not left; but the hamburger came to the side table; I'm breaking two points from here; other than that it was good."
CG,"Service, attention is excellent. The masters working in the kitchen love their job. Dining halls and sinks are very stylish; organized and hygienic."
CG,The presentation was very successful; the employees were very interested and thoughtful and everything was delicious. We thank you.
CG,Food service was also very fast. I ate a delicious Lokum meat. Then I ate an unbelievably good burger.
OR,The most successful steak restaurant in the region. It is also a world brand. With its carefully selected meats and cooking technique; it gives the price you what you pay.
CG,Prices are so high..
CG,I do not recommend the lamb cage at all. But skewered and tenderloin are great. My carrot slice isn't bad. The waiters are interested and polite; but there are difficulties in understanding the order. You would like it cooked well; it comes undercooked.
CG,We've been here many times and each time we left satisfied; Lokum meat; spaghetti; nusret hamburger; salad with tulum cheese; etc. very good but of course high in price compared to many places.
OR,It's as if your old meticulousness is gone. The cage arrived cold; the salad came for 1; I said two; I did not drink alcohol; but 6 double raki was written in my account; when I told the waiter; he said are you sure you didn't drink?
OR,There is a queue at the door; there are wonderful places in Sarıyer. I came with the force of my friends; the music chosen is similar to the music played in Italian pizzeria.
CG,He's very successful. Even though it was very crowded; the service was incredibly fast.
OR,By the lake; with a beautiful view; ducks are swimming next to you. 1 pan of squid; 1 portion of sea bass; 1 salad; 2 50 sized tuborgs; 2 tea 80 TL.
CG,The presentations are very good; it obviously has a skilled and attentive chef. Fish and squid are fresh.
OR,DEFINITELY DO NOT COME. We came here for breakfast based on the reviews on the way. We said the breakfast called the village breakfast for 2 people. First of all; the employee greeted us disrespectfully; a thousand pieces falling off his face; reluctant movements etc. It didn't taste good either!
CG,Right next to the Köyceğiz lake; the prices are a click above the average; a good business with a panoramic view of the lake.
CG,Thank you.
CG,Mexican chicken was hearty; hot and fresh in portion. Service was a little late. An ideal place to dine with a lake view.
OR,Koycegiz is the most popular restaurant and cafe. You can have a meal with the view of Köyceğiz lake and sip your cold beer with pleasure.
OR,A place we stopped by for breakfast on the way. The place has a beautiful view of Köyceğiz lake. The owner is very sweet and helped us with everything.
CG,It was rainiy but the ambiance was good enough.
CG,They bring delicious yoghurt to the dishes; the portions are hearty; with a beautiful view of the lakeside.
CG,I recommend the handmade hamburger at a good price; reasonable (50TL) and satisfying. Sprinkled village breakfast (125 TL per person) is a weak; ordinary breakfast.
CG,Tantuni was amazing. We just came here to try it.
CG,In general; it is delicious; you can ask for both wrap and bread. Although the waiting time is around 10 minutes; the red cabbage and pickled peppers served from the front satisfy you.
CG,It is a cheap and delicious place for students.
CG,Tantuni was amazing. Thank you Cici Tantuni!
OR,The pickles that came after you placed your order were very nice. Tantuni is not bad; you can try it. But I would say it's a little oily.
CG,Great tantuni; thanks!
CG,The ambiance of the place was a bit dark.
CG,I tried tantuni with yoghurt for the first time. The taste was perfect. I would recommend it to everyone. It reminds me of the taste of iskender.
CG,Prices are like that.
CG,It was very oily; but good in taste. Prices are a little higher than usual.
CG,Not bad.
CG,If you want a different taste in Kaş; they serve it by putting meat; chicken or meatballs cooked for a long time on the bun bread; you can order the drink separately with fried potatoes.
CG,A fast food restaurant with very friendly staff. It didn't appeal to my taste at all. Undercooked dough and lint meat.
OR,Overall it wasn't bad. It was delicious and ice cold. Mohair meat was delicious. The fries were nice. However; the bread that gives the place its name is a disappointment.
CG,It has a hearty menu that starts with a very sweet encounter; it was quite delicious; the pepper sauce they made is successful.
CG,There are many options on the menu and the average portion price is 50 TL. One portion is very satisfying; but if you don't like dough; you've come to the wrong address. They put the ingredients of your choice between a soft steamed bread.
OR,I really liked the handmade basil buttermilk and lemonade. The chicken sandwich is okay; I think the chocolate one has nothing to say; it only had strawberries in it; there could be more fruit like waffles.
CG,I can say that cleanliness; taste; warm-blooded employees were absolutely perfect.
CG,We came to Bunbun for a snack at noon. We generally liked what we ate; including the vegan ones. We especially loved the one with beetroot. Meaty ones are nice. I really liked their fries.
CG,They make hamburgers from bun bread and come with french fries. Quite tasty and satisfying.
OR,If you come to Kaş and do not eat bunbun here; you are not considered to have come to Kaş. I would definitely recommend you to try it. Especially the ayran is wonderful.
CG,We ordered meatballs and handmade meatballs that were baked for 6 hours. Meatballs were delicious; meat was delicious.
CG,Even though it was overcrowded; our orders came very quickly. Except for the künefe; all the treats were delicious. The künefe tasted oily. I recommend you to go to a very clean and relevant place.
CG,You get full like crazy in the range of 150-200 per person. It's beautiful inside. Easy to access.
CG,Orders that came really shockingly fast and the treats were delicious.
CG,The treats were excellent; but I did not like the main dish; it was not fully cooked; other than that; the treats and service were very good.
OR,"I always go to this restourant, the treats are constantly renewed and the kebabs are good. There are sweet treats after the meal. The only problem is that it is usually very full and noisy."
CG,The treats are constantly being refreshed.. all the waiters are very interested.. The taste was not overly good.
CG,There was no delay in meals. As soon as the soup was finished; the meal arrived. The meals are quite delicious.
CG,As soon as you sit down; treats come to your table. Abundant; varied and constantly renewed refreshments. It is a recommendation to everyone who got full marks from us...
CG,Lots of quality extras and unlimited treats. After the meal; cigarettes are offered as a treat; which is very interesting.
CG,This is the best aspava restaurant. The treats were perfect.
OR,Appetizers and service came quickly. The glasses are badly scratched. Especially the fries were fresh and delicious. Raw meatballs and stuffed meatballs were like mud without flavor.
CG,I recommend profiteroles and meringue; they are their own production. The entrance is suitable for the disabled. It's good that they're paying attention to this.
CG,The best place to eat local food in Muğla. Master Fikret's food is excellent. You should definitely stop by here.
CG,I went with my friends; their milk desserts were very good.
CG,The cheddar pastry was very bad compared to the past. It has reached the level of a normal patisserie; it used to be better.
CG,We went to eat dessert as a family and we were satisfied. It was a bit crowded.
OR,It's cold and extremely bad; the price of the food is way above its quality; 46 liras for 6 meatballs; 30 minutes or more waiting time. I definitely don't recommend it.
CG,Very good quality and expensive also always crowded.
CG,Good.
CG,Everything you eat is very fresh and delicious. The back of the place is in the concept of a restaurant and the 2nd floor is in the concept of a cafe. We liked it very much.
CG,I ate awesome pasta; I recommend to you..
CG,Recommend.
OR,It can be preferred for breakfast. The salt of the flakes was a little lacking; so it affects the taste; but it was not a problem.
CG,"Bagel / crispy is tasteless; the outer crust is hard, and the tea is tasteless due to its water. Boiled egg craved but I gave up because it was peeled."
CG,Prices are very affordable; boyoz is fresh and nice. Finding breakfast items such as olives; cheese and honey in addition to Boyoz also adds to the beauty.
CG,The most beautiful boyoz is clear here! Those who claim otherwise should reconsider their taste. I have never eaten such good boyoz in my life.
CG,I like it a lot. Prices are reasonable. Many varieties of boyoz available.
CG,In terms of taste; minced meat and pastrami were very good. Tahini was medium. Olive was good too.
CG,The boyoz with mozzarella was legendary; the salt taste coming from the back really makes the boyoz delicious.
CG,It's a very cute oven. It opens early in the morning. Boyozes are very delicious; I loved the one with mozzarella.
CG,I ate boyoz for the first time. For me; I guess I wouldn't eat it again. Frankly; it's not a taste that I will look for and miss.
OR,I ate a variety of boyoz for the first time and I liked it very much. The service is fast and the atmosphere is friendly. If you come to Izmir; do not pass by here.
CG,I came with recommendation and it really tasted good. It doesn't have a very different taste; so I don't think you will have a problem whether it fits your palate or not.
CG,It was the best SushiCo restaurant I've experienced. Sushi was perfect and delicious.
OR,First of all; our orders came very quickly. Edamame came without salt; which we liked a lot. You can add your own. We ordered tuna and salmon as sashimi. I couldn't eat good sashimi in Istanbul for a long time; unfortunately this place did not pass the exam.
CG,Great atmosphere!
CG,Service was good; transportation was easy. Prices are above average. For those who don't like the taste of raw fish; I recommend roles instead of nigiri.

CG,Pretty good sushi; attentive; friendly service..
CG,Liked.
CG,The flavors were good in general; the prices were a bit high.
CG,It didn't suit my taste but my wife loved it. The place was beautiful.
OR,Started off well with nice duck sushi and prawn gyoza; but was given wrong meat in pad Thai so sent it back. No apologies. Ordered spring rolls; they never came.
CG,Very clean restaurant... Tasty suchi and noodles.
CG,We ordered sole fish; fried haddock; fried mussels; and sardines. Our favorite among them was sole fish. The only thing that bothered me was that the men's and women's toilets were a common and single toilet.
OR,The taste really lives up to expectations. It is a business that maintains frying fish; which is essentially a fast food; in accordance with its craft. I liked.
CG,Delicious!
CG,Very cheap against portions.
CG,Our back hurt while eating; the place was clean.
CG,Fish and bread are delicious but the place has gone back every year. Cleanliness and hygiene are almost non-existent; employees are weary and reluctant.
CG,I think they cook very fast and delicious fish; and they have very sweet employees; I definitely recommend them. I also strongly recommend the pickle juice and sole fish.
CG,Prices are a little bit high.
CG,We ate our meal on the top floor; the location of the place was beautiful. The flavors and portions were good. I suggest you to eat fish bread.
CG,I went to there with my girl friend; I liked fishes but she did not like because fishes are a little bit oily.
CG,Portions are huge.. sardines are delicious; fish is very oily; so you have to eat bread. Therefore; the best choice is between bread.
OR,There are only Kumru and Kumpir options; the Kumru is not bad; it needs a little more oil; I can't say it's very tasty. The place is beautiful in terms of location; but there is a crowd; so the staff cannot keep up.
CG,The material of the kumru is medium quality; the portion is small. We were 3 persons. All three of us had burnt bread.
CG,Excellent. I recommend.
CG,I ate the best dove I've ever eaten here. Everyone should come!!
CG,"Crowded but no problem, flavor is okay."
CG,"Kumpir is delicious. Super Kumru is really good. Compared to other places, we can say that the prices are reasonable and the service quality is high. quality materials used."
CG,I'm really surprised; it's a huge business; but the staff is so indifferent and bored.
OR,"Beautiful place; in a perfect location; clean and equipped with quality; these definitely deserve a star; but as someone who loves dove and has experienced it in every corner of Izmir (Alçatı; Bostanlı; İnciraltı; Çeşme; etc.), this ""dove"" is not the only thing that can be said."
OR,Food came a little late but that was okay. Prices were as you can see in the photo. It wasn't a bad experience.
CG,I can recommend it to those who want to eat a delicious dove in a beautiful place. Kumru's price is 45₺.
CG,Definitely. Texts the dove's book. The Kumpir they ordered was also excellent.
CG,Bread was a bit stale and no problem except taking the order late and waiting. Meatballs are delicious as always.
CG,The order came fast. I loved the doner and chicken. It was well cooked. But orders came late.
CG,The place was really dirty and the orders came late.
CG,Great service.
CG,The fact that all the employees were women made me very happy; the tastes were good.
CG,Their service was a little slow; the flavors were on point. I had breakfast; there was unlimited tea; it was a different situation that they brought the tea in a water glass.
CG,Great service; attention and relevance It was nice. Everything was perfect.
CG,Its meatballs are beautiful. So is soup and salad too.
CG,The meat had a fabricated taste.
CG,Kofteci Yusuf tastes the same everywhere. employees are constantly running towards somewhere; it is very difficult to catch and order.
OR,We told the staff a very modest breakfast plate; there is unlimited tea; and the breakfast was really good. There was everything up to 4 kinds of cheese and it only cost 54 liras.
CG,Nice atmosphere; pleasant place. The employees are young; smiling and fast. The breakfast is very nice. Souffles are A-MA-ZING!
CG,They do sushi every thursday and I missed so it was a little sad to miss it. Other than that; the food was good.
CG,Definitely the best soufflé I've had in a long time. I am satisfied; I recommend.
CG,Asian salmon pastas and salad varieties are very successful. They have not neglected to share the secret of their taste.
CG,Not bad.
CG,Souffle heaven has a wonderful variety of flavors; I highly recommend it.
CG,The waiters were understanding; but the food came cold and late.
CG,I tried Antep taco; I liked.
CG,The prices are the same as the market; but the staff and service quality are better than others; their special tastes are definitely recommended.
CG,Not very special Gaziantep dishes; but you can find a comfortable and serene atmosphere in Antep. One of the places that can be stylish for the evening.
CG,Taco; on the other hand; was no different than a vegetable wrap wrapped in lavash. It was a decent experience.
CG,The staff is very fast; the waffles are great; I definitely recommend it.
CG,The waffle was very successful; especially the dough was very delicious. The ice cream they use with such a nice waffle is of very poor quality. The only negative thing is that the employees are constantly checking to see if the food is finished.
CG,Although they are actually a place that makes waffles; their burgers are delicious and they have a lot of options.
CG,It had very good service. It was also nice to have a lot of choices in waffles.
OR,You can add the product you want to the waffle or hamburger with your own choice. You're kind of the chief.
CG,Waffles were delicious and their tea was fresh. It wasn't insane for the price. I'm thinking of coming again.
CG,Everything was very good; the waffles were very tasty; the employees were very concerned and smiling. It is recommended.
CG,It's a great place with everything; it's a very good place whether it's about food or interest; it's a very nice place for waffles.
CG,I can say that it is the only cafe in Samsun where you can eat waffle dessert properly. You can go without thinking.
CG,"Good waffles, we liked it."
CG,I ate better waffle's in past.
CG,It was the most delicious adana kebab I ate in Alanya. The prices were also normal. The only thing missing was the salad.
CG,Renovated is pretty good. There is nothing to say about the food and the soups. Especially the lahmacun was perfect.
CG,don't accidentally break a glass or plate; they add 20 lira to your account unannounced.
CG,Location of the restourant was good; easy to access.
OR,Everything is very good; thank you for your efforts; the meats and dishes in the newly added a la carte menus are legendary; I definitely recommend it.
CG,smiling employees..
CG,Good place to eat. However; the staff work poorly: They can easily forget to bring some dishes or add seasonings; even though they previously admitted to the contrary.
CG,Not the best; but not bad.
CG,Quite unpolite service; but the meal was good. The salad with the vinegar was extremely good.
CG,Everything was great; definitely coming back when I'm in Alanya again.
CG,We came here with my family. Staff was very friendly; responsive and professional. Our order was delivered very quickly. The restaurant serve Turkish cuisine. One of the best in Alanya. Recommended.
CG,I drank Beyran soup; the taste of the soup was not bad. The lahmacun was good.
CG,Beyran is really delicious; the service is fast. Friendly and warm waiters.
CG,We came to drink beyran soup for breakfast. We really liked the taste. The accompanying breads were delicious.
OR,I had eaten Beyran in a few places; but I didn't like it very much. I drank here and liked it. I can drink it every day.
CG,We went for Beyran but it didn't in menu today. We had to order lahmacun and kebab. The lahmacun is awful; the adana kebab and lamb shish kebab are delicious.
CG,I ate katmer here for the first time and I couldn't forget its taste and smell. It may be the most beautiful dessert in the world!!
CG,We ate Beyran. We preferred less spicy; the price is 60 TL. The place is clean; the service is fast.
CG,Lahmacun was terrible.
CG,We tried Lahmacun and Beyran. They were beautiful; thank you.
CG,I'm ending my vacation by leaving my favorite food here..
OR,We had the opportunity to taste beyran for the first time in our lives and we had heard of the reputation of Metanet's beyran. At first; we had a bit of a prejudice; to be honest; about the intense aroma of meat or fat; but it's not like that at all. Beyrani is so delicious and balanced that we can eat it at any time of the day; morning; noon and evening.
CG,A very nice place; five stars as the location. If it is the flavor you are looking for; you may not find the exact flavor that you want.
CG,Everything is fine; but I have to deduct 1 point because of the prices. There is no problem in taste; presentation and cleanliness.
OR,They used to taste better; the chef must have changed.
CG,Great services.
OR,In terms of price performance; I think it is quite reasonable. Employees were also very kind; thank you. I was very satisfied with the spicy-sweet sauce chicken I ate. Only the fries on the side were too simple in my opinion.
CG,Breakfast in the morning is usually very crowded on weekends. Service may be delayed. Meals wasn't bad.
CG,Compared to other places; it was more airy and calm by the sea. Thanks.
CG,Great ambiance; delicious dishes..
CG,Due to the crowd; my order came late; there is no problem other than that.
CG,The food is delicious; the view is beautiful.
CG,I went on the recommendation of my friend. Everything at breakfast was delicious. Only the butter had a peculiar smell.
OR,The strawberry cake was great; there was fresh dough. And we only paid for what we ate; drank; portioning; etc. no extra fees were asked. It's a wonderful place
CG,When there are so many employees; orders are forgotten; tables are not looked at. The food is really delicious.
OR,I definitely come here every time I come; I like both breakfast and evening meals; but prices have increased a lot from last year to this year.
CG,The worst service I have seen; no one knows what they are doing 
CG,If you want a delicious and local breakfast on the beach; you should definitely try it.Kuymak is even closed to discussion.

CG,My first stop for breakfast in Atakum is a place with quality service and friendly face.
CG,It's nice to have a children's playground. There are a lot of staff working. Good as place and location.
OR,The tastes; the approach of the stuff to you and the quality of service are very good; of course; especially if you can find a place on the weekend.
CG,Teas we could only drink 1 tea for a cold breakfast; the staff is being artistic to the customer; fighting and walking on top of him; there is an uncomfortable environment.
CG,This place is beautifully decorated; has excellent staff; successful flavors; plenty of variety.
CG,The service is absolutely amazing; the working friends are very kind; there is no need to explain the taste; it is a restaurant that should definitely be visited.
CG,Portions were very filling and good. We had a nice Sunday breakfast.
CG,The view is nice; the indoor seating area is quite large.
OR,It is a place to eat good pastries in Sariyer. I recommend you to try the mince raisin. Tea 5 TL 1 portion of Meat Pie with Raisins 30 TL
CG,Pastries varieties and pogaca are delicious. There are also breakfast options available. The staff is caring and helpful. Service is fast. I think the prices are reasonable.
CG,Good with potatoes; good with cheese; medium with spinach; medium with minced meat. Plain pastry was good; pastry was good. I did not like the tea.
CG,Great.
CG,The prices were too high for a place that sells pastries or pastries.
CG,I'm a regular at currants and pastries with minced meat. It is both delicious and definitely does not disturb the stomach after eating.
OR,Service sucks. Customer care is below zero. The view is very good but the place is extremely neglected.
CG,It gets very crowded because it's the weekend; we have to go a little early; you may not find a place to eat something
CG,It's too plentiful; so I guess the prices are high. But a mixture of so many different dishes was not that good.
CG,The most delicious rice I have ever eaten. The ambiance of the environment is terrific; its desserts were amazing too.
CG,I ate baruthane kebab with rice; it was very good; a little expensive.
CG,The place is beautiful and clean. The employees were very kind and concerned. I ate rice and also had sautéed chicken. The flavor was good except the chicken sauté was greasy.
CG,Prices was high.
CG,It was nice experience; you have to try it.
OR,250 TL account was received for 1 portion of rice + kuru fasulye + ayran + Cola. Service and waiters are very bad.
CG,It's not something to be exaggerated; and people come from out of town just for their rice. The waiters were kind; the environment was clean.
CG,The flavor is excellent. Roasting meat was like cotton. Price is a little above normal. Location of the restourant was really good.
CG,There was only 3-4 chickpeas in my rice; it was a bit unsalted. Treats were good. It had a classic rice flavor.
CG,The menu is very nice; the food is legendary; also the waiters were very polite.
CG,I had high expectations but the kebabs were unsuccessful. Hummus was good. They use quality olive oil.
OR,There was a hair strand in my food! There is no problem in service or interest other than this issue; they give the right to the fee they receive.
OR,"They have very delicious meat; especially tiny lahmacun, super appetizers; delicious food here. The food is very nice. The workers can be a little more interested. They are very interested in Arab customers. They don't care about us. This situation makes us sad."
CG,Nice place but the order came very late; the prices are not so high. It can be tried.
CG,"very clean table arrangement is good; waiters are very interested; they look immediately; the order comes without a long wait, the food is really delicious as it is said; it is excellent; I recommend it."
CG,We came with a guest from abroad; everything was perfect. Taste; cleanliness; service..
CG,It is a luxurious place where you can try the delicious tastes of both Turkish and Arabic cuisine.
OR,Please review the ticket slip. A business that wants money for the bread on the table; 20 TL for the service fee; 20 TL for the valet.
OR,Unfortunately; the waiters are very uninterested. Since there are too many Arab customers; the attention and interest is more towards them. Stones were found in my food?!
CG,Even though the service is terrible; they ask for a service fee of 144 TL; what a nonsense!
CG,Hatay gastronomy house is an excellent place; you should definitely go... Quality and affordable...
CG,Ambient food; nice open area; heated pet friendly place; renovated garden is very nice.
CG,The venue is beautiful. Food/desserts taste good. I loved the Popcorn Shrimp from the hot appetizers. I loved Pose Armut. Overall good price/performance.
CG,We went for both breakfast and dinner. First of all; it has a very nice environment. When we went for breakfast; we sat inside and one can sit for hours. Its decoration; quiet and nice; being in the trees is very nice. Especially having an open kitchen adds a positive score to the customer.
OR,The place is very beautiful; the food is so delicious; you can go with your pet to one of the rare restaurants that cook the meat to the exact consistency you want. The toilets are not separate for men's and women's toilets so there was a bit of a cleaning problem.
CG,The service is slow; I think there is a lack of staff and unhappiness; it has not to expensive and it was seedy experience.
CG,Although it was crowded; the ambiance and food of the place was nice. Thank you.
CG,Great place.. Contrary to the comments; the employees were interested.. The hot dog was impressive.. The hamburger was not bad.
OR,Despite the current times; it was a very pleasant visit. They currently don’t take booking; they have a walk-in system where you put your name down and after a short wait they seat you inside. Once inside you can opt to be put on a waitlist to sit outside. The setting is really nice and rustic and the tables are well distanced. There was a nice evening crowd and a good energy in the ambience.
CG,The service provided was very nice; I was happy.
OR,Smoked salmon salad was average. Colored eggs do not contribute to the taste. Salmon was too salty; fried potatoes were bland.
CG,Eggs Benedict with pork bacon was nice.
CG,Excellent taste; and the shabbyness of the place was also nice.
CG,A full student meal. The price is cheap and the taste is high.
CG,It's a place with very affordable and delicious pasta. Actually; there is not much variety of pasta. Classic pasta is served with cheddar cheese and sauce. I think the taste and price of the pasta is very good.
CG,They serve an uncooked pasta with a tasteless sauce and cheese and some corn. Half portion is 20 TL. It didn't suit my taste.
CG,I think it was pretty cool. The price of a portion of pasta was 22 TL. I highly recommend you go.
CG,classic alavara pasta; if you don't have a tiny little stomach; say it right. Pasta 42 TL price performance product...
CG,The taste is unbelievably good and satisfying enough; it is also very affordable; but you have a hard time finding an incredibly crowded place.
CG,Not to mention pasta; their sauces are so successful that you can destroy the whole plate without noticing. Also; the dumplings are nice.
CG,Tasty meals.
CG,It was the most delicious pasta I have ever eaten; thank you.
CG,Service was fast. I ate ravioli; it was good.
CG,Surprised location; but nice clean venue. The employees are friendly; I don't want to comment on the prices; they were too high..
CG,In general; I was satisfied; since the hamburger is a little small; it will be more satisfying if the one with a higher grammage is chosen.
CG,Burgers are great hot dogs do. It is very interesting that french fries are 114 TL.
CG,Hamburger is really delicious. The fries are normal.
CG,The best hamburger restaurant in Istanbul. Cooking and sauce is very good.
CG,Burgers are super. I've eaten hamburgers in many places; but I've never come across anything like this. Fantastic meal with friendly service in a small but cozy place. I strongly recommend.
CG,The delicious combination of truffle sauce and burger was legendary.
CG,It was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. The only downside is that the portion is a little small. Apart from that; it is definitely a place to experience.
CG,Well prepared hamburger; special taste. But a little bit expensive.here/
CG,It is delicious in everything with its sauce and bread.
CG,The taste is good; but it's not worth paying 90 TL for a wet hamburger-sized burger and not even getting fries...
CG,They make the pizza in a wood fired stone oven. It's different than any pizza you've experienced before. They use cheddar cheese as cheese. We preferred the 2 and 3 special pizzas.
CG,I definitely recommend the seasonal kenger pizza. We also loved the sauce in three different olive oils; one with garlic; thyme and hot pepper.
CG,You can't get enough of the thin pizza dough. Overcrowded employees are very concerned. We ate pizza at Mia highly recommend.
OR,Staff were quick but surly. the service was actually fast; i can't afford it. We ordered chicken and mushroom pizza; its taste was normal; the dough was very thin and it wasn't burnt; which was the only good thing. Coming to the wage issue; there were prices that did not match the prices of luxury restaurants.
CG,I think it's a nice place. Pizza was also nice; but a little expensive. I liked their sauce.
OR,First of all; the atmosphere is nice; but there should be a solution for flies in the open air; such as fans that blow water. As for the pizza; although the view is beautiful; neither my wife and I did not like the pizza; unfortunately; the sauces that came only to pour on the pizza were good.
CG,You should definitely go once and eat pizza. But I don't know if it happened to us; but the faces of the employees were never smiling and they were not caring.
CG,We did pizza experience after a long road. As a place; it is very nice; pizzas are delicious; but we can say that the prices are a bit expensive.
CG,Amazing pizzas omg!
CG,The place is spacious; clean. Pizza dough is thin. You had the chance to try 6 types of pizza; I can say that the best is the model with spinach and smoked turkey.
CG,"The dough is very crispy and the most successful part is definitely the dough. And the dough was waiting overnight. Also, there is a 2-3 hour queue; so crowded."
CG,The flavors are number 10. A little expensive; it may be too much for people with a medium budget.
CG,I ate küşleme; simit kebab; mixed cubes. The frosting was juicy and pretty good.
CG,Meats are tasty without fat; but not very suitable for me. Since I like the meat cooked more; I couldn't enjoy it much anyway; I couldn't finish what I ordered. Although the portions are small; the prices are quite expensive.
OR,I think the place is overrated. We said mixed in the middle; it was a disgusting image. Simit kebab was good. But the prices were too high.
CG,Delicious but not overdone.
CG,Expensive.
CG,Deserts was amazing; especially baklava! Liked it.
CG,Its küşleme was great. It was very well cooked and juicy. However; the portion was small and they warn about this before ordering. Still; its meat is so delicious that it is worth eating. Prices are a little expensive.
OR,4 people mixed menu with their own salad; 750 TL. For those who say price is not a problem. Meat tastes excellent. There is a parking lot.
CG,We ate küşleme; it was amazing. But as you can see; really really expensive.
CG,We came from out of the town to try their meat. We waited in line for a while; but that's okay. It was an amazing experience. I recommend it to everyone.
CG,It was too oily and the place had problems with cleanliness.
CG,It was too spicy on my first try; but after a few bites I got used to it. The taste is really good; I like it.
CG,it tasted so good that I even ordered and ate the second one!
CG,The taste is good but not satisfying.
CG,Deliciousss!
CG,We came to Abidin Tantuni with my friends from out of town. The pickles and of course the tantuni were very nice.
CG,Tantuni is delicious; service is fast; service is quality. Price of one portion is 85TL
CG,Great job; thank you!
CG,we had a delicious tantuni experience. I was amazed by the taste of ayran; pickles and tantuni trio.
CG,One of the Most Beautiful Meat Tantuni Places. Meat tantuni is very tasty. It's a roadside place. It's a regular restaurant.
CG,The smell is awesome; the taste is normal; the speed is very good. We are full; thank you very much. Ayran was also nice.
CG,We wanted to try this place as it is famous. We paid more than 800 liras for 2 people; 1.5 portions of Iskender and a drink.
OR,Iskender kebab is not a meal worth that much money when I look at the price of 195 TL for 1 portion; rather than its taste.
CG,Iskender is very delicious; you can optionally pour butter; what is interesting to me is that there are no treats.
CG,The first time I ate; it's really worth the price. Taste and hygiene are the most important for me. Toilets were clean.
CG,My order came cold.
CG,There is no problem of waiting queue; the ambiance of the place is nice; well done.
CG,It is very delicious; even the yogurt. However; a very very expensive portion of Iskender should not be 225 liras…
CG,Iskender kebab is a nice; clean and well-served place in Bursa.
CG,The interior is very well designed. It has a historical texture. Employees were engaged. Frankly; the taste of iskender was not overly good; it was normal.
CG,It was delicious as I heard.
CG,Expensive; poor presentation; taste was not good enough to come from out of town and try. There are no treats.
CG,The staff is very polite and very concerned. Thank you for the delicious food.
CG,We ate oil ravioli and special ravioli. The ravioli was weak compared to the price. Employees are smiling.
CG,We wanted to try it for yaglama; it was disappointing for me; it had little ground meat; it didn't taste good; the appetizers were bad.
CG,Not perfect but good.
CG,We ate special ravioli; classic ravioli; yaglama; they were not friendly; their yaglama was like minced meat pasta; not greasing.
CG,A very pleasant and quiet restaurant. Most importantly; the food is great. Everything I tasted was delicious.
CG,Recommend.
CG,The ravioli tasted good and was satisfying as a portion; the portion was very small compared to the price of the yaglama.
CG,The restaurant is very nice and elegant. We were greeted very kindly; the flavors were good.
CG,Legendary flavors; I was amazed!
CG,I tried Kayseri's traditional ravioli and special ravioli. The special was just right for my taste. I like. We also tried yaglama but it wasn't as good as I imagined. It was also cold.
CG,After waiting for about 20 minutes; we were able to eat Classic Ayvalık Toast. It was delicious and crunchy.
CG,Small busy place. We didn't wait long; service was fast. The toast was delicious but the portion was small and expensive.
CG,First of all; they don't accept credit cards. The place is small; you can wait in line to sit. It's worth the taste.
CG,I loved it; with one word it was legendary. In other words; it is the best toast you can eat outside. The price is 35 TL for full Ayvalik toast; Ayran Lemonade is 15 TL.
OR,Bread; cheese; sausage all left incredible flavors on our palate. We recommend it to everyone who will go to Ayvalık.
CG,Liked.
OR,We paid 150 TL for 2 toast and 2 ayran. The only address of Ayvalık Toast. There are many queues; but the queue moves very quickly. Worth the wait.
CG,Ambiance could be better.
CG,The place had problems with cleanliness. Prices were a little expensive.
CG,When you go to Ayvalık; I definitely recommend you to go here to eat toast. Perfect taste.
CG,Crispy and delicious toast.
CG,Excellent Roman pizza. Fast; pleasant and courteous service.
CG,What an awesome place. The fried starters were lush; as were the rice balls. However; the pizza was amazing; the best I have tasted (in Rome).
CG,It was quite crowded so we waited in line for a long time. The flavor was good.
CG,Authentic Italian restaurant; best pizza I ever ate in my life. You know it’s going to be good when Italians go there. Prices are really cheap as well; it was only 8€ for my pizza.
CG,I strongly recommend. The best of the best. Very thin and soft. Nice service and reasonable price.
CG,The pizzeria in the heart of Testaccio is open from 19:00 without reservation... fills up immediately. Excellent typical Roman pizza.
CG,Great thin crust pizza. Its super busy so be prepared for a decent wait. The suppli and fiore di zucca aren't the best; but the pizzas are top notch.
CG,It was much better on our last visit (6 years ago). This time we were not satisfied with the service or the quality of the pizza.
CG,"Not touristic, that's why super. The place is real; truly local; authentic. Atmosphere here is really special. Waiters are cool guys; not trying to be super polite. Love it!"
CG,Awesome locals spot for pizza and typical Roman fare.
CG,Best pizza around. GOAT status. Have to try that Diavola pizza. Absolutely no cap!
CG,The food is quite delicious. The prices are higher than the average in Samsun; but suitable for a decent place. The waiters were interested; the appetizers were delicious.
OR,Diyarbakır Ocakbasi is one of the most established places of Samsun; but I couldn't understand this branch. The taste of the food is very good; there is no problem about it; but the service is very heavy; the number of staff is insufficient.
CG,The view is beautiful; the food is good. It's about the waiters. If you are going alone in the evening; a reservation seems to be a must. Too crowded.
CG,It was a great place; the most beautiful meatloaf I've ever eaten in my life.  The cheddar lahmacun and stuffed ribs were perfect; and the meat had no smell. The service is nice; they respect.
OR,When we last arrived; many of the products on the menu were not available. It is also interesting that there are no liver skewers in the place called Ocakbasi.
CG,2 appetizers 1 salad the smell of blood and the taste of meat were disgusting chicken and lamb were fine.
CG,I gave unnecessary money. It had no taste; no service. It was very expensive.
OR,A restaurant that has lost its previous refinement. Lahmacun as seen in the photo. The service is slow. I recommend a little more wannabe and attention.
CG,The food was great; the service was fast and the staff was friendly. Stuffed ribs were very fresh and delicious.
CG,We tried Lahmacun and Beyti. They both taste great.
OR,Their meat was incredibly bad. Chicken canada had another taste.  The service is nice; but I would say the flavor is 0. In a cooker; this tastelessness is surprising; obviously.
CG,It's nice that it's open every time in a day. Turkish coffee + tea + 2 pastries =52TL. Service is average... Turkish coffee is not tasty.
CG,Delicious tastes; clean place.
CG,We have a full breakfast and pay 20 TL. Isn't it perfect?
CG,We had a pleasant breakfast in a bright environment.
CG,There's a mess inside; the business really needs to improve on the organization.
CG,A bakery and Patisserie that offers quality; delicious and plenty of options.
CG,Great cafe. Excellent staff. Brilliant cakes and pastries.
CG,Thanks for great breakfast experience!
CG,It seems like the products were better last year.. There is always a queue.
CG,The donut had no filling in it so it was like sweet bread.
CG,Loved.
CG,Prices were cheap. But the queue was too long. I liked the flavors as a korean.
CG,A delicious udon that you can enjoy even in the middle of summer! It was very hot; cramped and crowded with people and I had two bowls of udon and a side dish with two bottles of booze.
CG,The set composition was good! Chicken egg rice and karaage were delicious. Many Koreans come here for udon. Waiters are friendly and service is fast!
CG,Lovely and delicious..
OR,5-10 min walk from the Louvre (depending on which side you come from). I ate really delicious things. I would definitely recommend.
CG,The best udon restaurant in the capital! Few tables however; making a lot of waiting at peak times.
CG,The queue was not that long fortunately! The staffs were all very kind and welcoming. The food was amazing! The udon was the hero; it was very flavorful & juicy!
CG,There were few tables and chairs inside.
CG,Best udon in Paris. Well Korean celebrities visits it too. Just a little bit crowded.
CG,"As an udon restaurant close to the Louvre; it tastes just as good. There's quite a line at lunch, but your turn comes quickly."
CG,The tempura here is amazing.
CG,Fast food restourant with a nice view. Staff are also friendly; mostly frequented by tourists.
CG,Very very bad food and very bad service 0/10.
CG,A very small hamburger. I can say that there are places where you can eat bigger and delicious hamburger menus for cheaper. The place is very busy and small. Finding a place to sit is a miracle.
CG,Classic KFC.
CG,I love fried chicken; I love KFC.
CG,The menu I ordered was served hot; I ate it with my mouth and it was really perfect. But the place is very small and full to the brim. There is no place to sit.
CG,It was delicious!
CG,The chickens are very nice and tasty; I will not say the same for the hamburger.
OR,Not friendly; zero customer service. Pretty disappointing. Limited ketchup sauce only two per customer..
CG,They applied extra price because we were tourists; they tried to defraud us officially.
CG,"The place is very nice; I think, the food was fresh and good; one of my favorite places."
OR,I ate a lot of croissants; but this was the best quality beautiful croissant I've ever eaten in my life. Crispy on the outside; with lots of butter on the inside; the smell was amazing.
CG,The place was crowded when we first went. We preferred chocolate croissants. It was fresh and beautiful.
OR,Three of us went and had Avocado & Poached Eggs; Sausage Scrambled Eggs; Mushroom Scrambled Egg Croissant. I didn't like the avocado croissant because I don't like avocados.
CG,It's a very enjoyable place. The croissants are amazing! The butter feels very good in mouth; it is crunchy. Salty and sweet; they're all great.
CG,I recommend..
CG,Wonderful. The amount of butter used in the croissant was so good that it never lost its taste and crunch. The coffee was fresh and of good quality.
CG,Cheesecakes are a price / performance product; if they have it; you have to try it immediately. The teas were also very good.
CG,It was too busy for a Monday. We waited 45 minutes.
CG,The waiters were indifferent; I was not satisfied.
OR,The croissants were delicious but tasted a bit bitter due to overcooking. The croissant with adjika was excellent. But we waited a long time
OR,You wait in line for 20-50 minutes when you leave. Eating the poached egg croissant left a strange feeling in the mouth. Egg with mushrooms was unsalted.
OR,Each mussel costs 7 liras. The place is big can sit inside and outside. There is a Bosphorus view in the place.
CG,The kokorec and sauced mussels of this branch next to the sea are quite good.
CG,"In a word, super. No need for expensive places. Very tasty; very clean. You can sit at the tables overlooking the Bosphorus and have a pleasant and reasonably priced meal. The staff is very caring."
CG,Expensive.
CG,Not too good; not too bad either.
OR,10 mussels + half a kokorec is 240TL. Also; the place smells like toilet.
CG,I had the chance to try classic mussels and mussels with sauce. Both were beautiful. Kokorec was also good.
CG,Prices are a little bit high but tastes are nice.
CG,In a word; it is magnificent; this is the heart of mussels in Istanbul. Atom kokoreç must be tasted. The mussels with sauce are another good one..
CG,Taste has deteriorated compared to the past. I guess it's because he's famous. I do not recommend; you can eat betters in other restourants.
CG,Magnificent view and legendary taste; and kokorec is also very good; I recommend it to everyone.
CG,"If you go to Trabzon, it is a place you should definitely visit. I knew it was a historical rice cooker; and it tasted great."
CG,Rice and roast are delicious! The inside can be visited like a museum; the employees are friendly. It's a bit pricey though; bring cash with you.
OR,The rice was very oily but the roast was delicious. We paid 450₺ for 3 people. Prices are a little high.
CG,Dishes were really expensive.
CG,It's just perfect; there is nothing to say.
OR,A very authentic place; its roasted meat and bean on the rice is legendary… 1 portion is enough.. The taste of the compote they serve is indispensable…
CG,2 roasted meat on rice + a ayran and a compote; a total of :220 It was nice that it was better roasted than rice.
OR,I tried it after the positive reviews. Its rice and compote are nice. However; there are places in the Black Sea where I ate better roast beef. It's not a place I can say you should try. Prices are reasonable. The place is nice; the service was good.
CG,I have never eaten such delicious roasted rice anywhere. Service presentation and environment was very very nice.
CG,My order arrived late and cold. Prices were high.
CG,An incredibly beautiful atmosphere with its historical texture and story. We preferred Roasted Meat on the Rice; it was delicious. Portions are very filling.
CG,This is a place we always go for peri peri burger and crispy ravioli. Thanks for the treats.
OR,We ordered the Cream Croissant. The chocolate was bitter and too liquid; I think it would be better if Nutella was applied. It was not a dessert worth the price. (145₺). They also forgot the tea I ordered.
OR,It is much better decorated and the quality has been improved considerably. When you enter; a very pleasant cafe atmosphere and ambiance welcomes you. I recommend sitting close to the wood stove. We ordered breakfast and were satisfied. Toilets were very; very dirty.
CG,I drank Turkish coffee; it was good.
CG,The products were delicious; the atmosphere was nice. Prices are reasonable; service needs improvement.
CG,Great viewed restourant.
OR,I really liked the atmosphere. The breakfast was very good and worth the price. It is not very expensive; but it is not very affordable either; I think there are ideal prices. Desserts were also excellent.
CG,They are not good in hygiene; portions are big; taste is good; prices are above average.. View is good.
CG,Slow service; average taste.
CG,In short; the plates brought to you are no different from the ones on the menu. Pizza is definitely in the top three I've ever eaten.
CG,It's a nice cafe. A little curly haired busboy there was very kind to us. The service was nice.
CG,We came across the Pavlova dish; it was delicious. Their fruit pasta wasn't bad either; but the kids really liked it. The staff is very caring and helpful.
CG,Izmir bomb was nice. The ice cream tasted like milk (not goat's milk) that I was not used to; but it didn't bother me.
CG,I am attaching the photos I could take about the menu and its prices. Overall it wasn't bad.
CG,Although it is a classic; its products are ordinary. Prices are expensive for the quality.
CG,Lemonade and desserts were terrific.
CG,Everything we ordered was excellent especially the Pavlova cake.
CG,Great ambiance.
CG,I tried Pavlova but it was not what I expected. But it could also be about my choice.
OR,We tried Tripple Berry Cheesecake and Pistachio Ice Cream; Strawberry Ice Cream. It was a complete disappointment for us. Especially the pistachio ice cream was highly praised; we couldn't understand why he was bragging.
CG,Menu was like that. Average business.
CG,Prices too high Turkish coffee 42.5TL Salty cookies weak.
CG,Spacious; clean and comfortable place. Employees concerned. We didn't wait long for the order. It was one of the best lahmacun I've ever eaten. Prices are affordable.
CG,It is a place that can be preferred for taste; but the appetizer variety is very weak. The toilets smelled.
CG,The food is very delicious. I congratulate the value and sincerity of the employees in their work.
CG,The space is comfortable and spacious. The service is fast; the staff is concerned. There are many types of kebab. We ordered shish shish and Adana; the taste is satisfactory. Prices were like market average.
CG,Taste; hygiene; speed;service were all very good. I went for a late dinner; everything was very good.
CG,We came from out of town. Kebab and skewers were great; and the strained yogurt appetizer was delicious; we will definitely come to you next visit.
CG,The staff is very interested and fast; the environment is very nice; the food and appetizers are very tasty.
CG,I liked the kebab and salad; but I can't say the same for their appetizers. It was less in variety; unfortunately; it was unpleasant for those who came. The ambiance was great.
CG,It's delicious and the prices are reasonable. The appetizers are very filling and satisfying.
CG,We were satisfied with the food; but the toilets are very dirty; I am deducting points from this issue.
OR,Three Portions of Adana Kebab on one skewer and 3 drinks for 106 TL. My expectation was higher in terms of taste; but I cannot say that I could fully find this expectation. But the side dishes were not bad.
CG,Highly recommend for a different and delicious experience. Being on the beach is very good as a place. Toilets are clean. No bad odor or irritating.
OR,Everything really appeals to both the eyes and the stomach. They have an incredibly beautiful and varied menu. Prices are reasonable according to the taste; quality and satiety of the menu.
OR,Every meal is a source of happiness at Magro. This time we tried chicken with almond sauce and Mac and cheese bolognese; it was delicious. Portions are very filling and very reasonable for the price.
OR,Magro is a really nice place in terms of design. I ate chicken broth soup; tomato soup; magro burger and grilled sea bass. Presentation; portion and taste are good. However; it is very expensive.Service sucks.
OR,Unique in Alsancak Kordon.. Good food; especially chicken wrap is awesome.
CG,It is a classical home breakfast; so it is expensive for home breakfast.
CG,Bad breakfast experince for me.
CG,Everything I ate that in a super menu; was very good. I recommend this place to everyone.
CG,Great service; great food; everything is great!
CG,Nice and beautiful place. The breakfast spread was hearty and good. Prices are normal.

CG,We came here for the first time; we just tried the doner; it was good; the treats were not bad; the staff was very interested.
CG,Lahmacun tasted good and was filling. Some of the ingredients used in the salad started to deteriorate.
OR,They've updated the prices and it's as if they have reduced the portions. It is irritating that the edges of the plates are broken.
CG,Liked.
CG,I didn't like Iskender; the meat was not of good quality.
CG,Even though it's not as good as it used to be; it's still my choice. I would be more satisfied if they boiled the stuffed meatballs.
CG,Good in general. Quality for Kızılay and its surroundings. Lahmacun doesn't taste old...
CG,I go here for the lahmacun; I haven't tried their other dishes; but the lahmacun is very good.
CG,I eat it by putting adana kebab in between the lahmacun. Legend is delicious; try it!
CG,Service is good. Lahmacun was delicious.
CG,Turkish meat doner was good; liked.
CG,"Service, respect, taste literally 10/10."
CG,Definitely a good tripe soup; but I've had much better ones. Very clean place; prices are a bit expensive.
OR,In terms of taste; I can't say it's too good because we drink much better ones. As a business performance; even bread is sold for money alongside soup.
CG,Portion is enough; taste is average; but unfortunately there is no hygiene. We sat in the garden but there was a heavy smell in the environment.
CG,I found the trotter soup I was looking for; it was very nice; thank you. Employees are not friendly.
CG,The trotter soup I drank here is among the top 3 soups I've had in my life. The food of the place is very delicious; the service is impeccable.
CG,The taste is excellent; the portion size is good; the price is a bit expensive.
CG,Amazing!
CG,The business demands money from everything; no treats!
CG,Ankara's oldest and most beautiful soup restourant. Soups with very good hygiene can be eaten and drunk with peace of mind. Service is fast. Prices are a little high.
CG,Clean and decent place. I think it would be better if the soup was hot and fresh if there were bread facilities that came with it.
CG,The environment is clean and nice. The taste of the food was not bad either.
CG,I tried almost all of the dishes and they are very delicious; but the mushroom saute was a little oily; other than that; everything was delicious and good.. the staff were friendly and very kind.

CG,The ingredients used in the dishes were of very high quality. Really clean; decent and beautiful place.
CG,The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious... The service staff is very caring and attentive...
CG,Don't be fooled by the menus seen in the pictures. It seems less and smaller. I did not like the business; I do not recommend.
CG,Covered doner kebab pita is also really delicious in lahmacun with cubed cheddar... The attention and care of the employees is extraordinary.

OR,We can say that trotter soup is good. Rotary medium. Inside the restaurant it was very quiet. The staff is fast.
CG,The ambiance is large and airy. The waiters are attentive and the service is fast. The tomato paste goes well with the trotter. The price is very reasonable.
CG,A nice cozy place. It is easily accessible from all parts of the city. It is very interesting that the restaurant does not have a menu.

CG,Prices are not expensive; Mersin is a place where you can eat fish comfortably in the city; I recommend the fish soup.
CG,Ambiance is a little bit old; but it is okay.

CG,Place was not clear.

CG,Famous place; fast service; caring staff; the taste of the sherbet we tried for the first time was legendary.
OR,Our choice was Antep style lahmacun; since I ate it last time; I found it very dry inside; unfortunately the taste of garlic was barely felt. The cleanliness of the place was good.
CG,The variety is plentiful. Pretty clean and decent. They make very good dishes from the southeast of our country.
OR,Today we had the opportunity to try the stuffed meatballs and lahmacun. We could not taste the meat at all because the cumin in the stuffen meatballs was too much. Lahmacun is good.

CG,Everything was excellent. Thank you!
CG,A perfect view; a friendly and sincere service and great tastes...what more could you ask for?
CG,The view is great. This may be its only good feature. Apart from that; they have extremely rude employees.

CG,Yummy; delicious and wonderful.. The view is as beautiful as the food.
CG,We had dinner in a very stylish place with a beautiful view by the sea. The flavors were perfect.
CG,A decent place where you can dine under the trees; accompanied by the moonlight. Employees are friendly.
OR,Be sure to ask for all prices in advance. You'd definitely get charged triple the price and these guys will try to scam you in all possible ways. Including overcharging the market price; charging you for double the weight of the fish & serving you a half the fillet and all the bones to charge you for all that.
OR,The summer part of the place is stylish and pleasant; the view is wonderful. The food and appetizers are delicious. Prices were a little expensive.
CG,Generally good service thank you!
CG,Appetizers are great; the view is great; the place is beautiful; the fish is very fresh and delicious.

CG,The ingredients used in the salad were rotten; I didn't like it at all.
CG,Great chicken; thanks!
OR,The taste is fine; but when you wait for the waiter for 15 minutes to order and wait for the food for 15 minutes after placing the order; the taste is meaningless. Waiters were very indifferent.
CG,Recommend.
CG,It had nothing to do with the chicken world flavor I knew.
CG,Very tasty; I definitely recommend. The reason I gave 4 stars is because the prices are expensive.
CG,We ordered cafe de paris; it was delicious; and the price was 35tl.
CG,It is very crowded and arrives incredibly late. If you are very hungry; it is better to eat somewhere else.
CG,Salad was not very fresh.

CG,Thanks for the nice service.
CG,Nice salad; it was delicious.
OR,We randomly decided to stop by and have an ice cream; but we tasted the worst ice cream we've ever had in our lives here. I don't know if it was one of the flavors they used; but the products seemed to be out of date.
CG,Have you ever seen a rainbow in these colors?! The 5-year-old boy would draw the umbrella more beautifully; which was said to be made of sugar dough. The cake doesn't even stand up straight. A birthday cake would only be so sloppy.
CG,The pastry is very nice . It is more affordable compared to other places. I highly recommend other products.
OR,It is clean and hygiene rules have been followed. The products are daily and fresh.  It is very rich in diversity. Every product you are looking for is available. You can shop without thinking at all.
CG,Don't order anything at home; they're sending a stale dessert.
OR,I didn't like the atmosphere or the decor either. The lower floor is in front of the highway. Trucks are passing by; you're eating pies. It's not nice and it's expensive. Oh; and there are a lot of beggars.
CG,My and my 3.5-year-old daughter's favorite place is in Samsun; we love the products of this place the most.
OR,They have very high quality cakes; I strongly recommend. Their baklava alone is not that good. Cookies are expensive; but they're fine.
CG,They have various and delicious products. Especially the age cakes are very successful. The materials they use in the products are of high quality; the prices are reasonable according to the quality.
CG,You won't regret that the products taste very good; but I've never seen such a bad staff before; definitely don't sit down and drink tea and coffee; take the product and leave; that's the most logical thing.
CG,it is a very nice place for high quality and special tastes; the employees and the owner are very interested and polite; we are going with love.
CG,Chinese salad and spring rolls were okay. I didn't like the veggie noodles very much. The plum sauce of the peking duck was delicious but the presentation was poor.
CG,A place with a nice ambiance and delicious sushi. It may be called expensive; but unfortunately; the taste is not affordable.
CG,The ambiance of the place is nice but the food is not tasty. I don't think I will come again.
CG,When you come to the front of the place; its magnificent exterior design really draws attention and I think it was done very well and I personally liked it very much. The atmosphere is truly magnificent. We tried Chinese food; especially ramen was delicious.
CG,"The atmosphere is nice and the food is delicious. We tried noodles, spring rolls; hot and sour soup and an apple dessert."
CG,Food was a bit salty due to soy sauce. Prices are in line with the market.
OR,The plate in the photo was around 340 TL. Flavors may be a bit difficult for those who will try for the first time.
CG,I tried peking duck with orange and soy sauce. It had a somewhat offensive odor. Good in terms of taste.
OR,It has cheaper price compared to other chinese restaurants. But the flavors were not that good. What was particularly interesting to me was that the drinks were very expensive.
OR,The outside and inside of the restaurant is very well decorated. The ambiance is really nice. We ate sushi; chicken with mushrooms and steamed ravioli. I really liked the sushi and chicken; but I found the ravioli a bit bland.
CG,We ate 3 Bentos and 3 Mixed Noodles. We liked everything we ate; it was very tasty. The service was fast; but it was a bit expensive for your information.
CG,One of the places in Samsun with the most beautiful view and menu. A place where you can enjoy your dessert and coffee to the full while enjoying the sea view in front.
OR,First of all; the service is slow and very late; and there are no crowds. I ordered a bulk profiterole. The portion also had 4 balls the size of nuts; and the chocolate was also tasteless.
OR,Atakum Mado... What a need for another word... The taste;  quality of the products are ala. It is very nice that the service staff is kind; solution-oriented. Especially the sensitivity of the company official; it is very nice to be relevant.
CG,There is no need to tell Mado at length; it is a clean and beautiful place.  But there is no standard; kadayif burma with pistachios used to be so unique that I would like to eat it everyday. But now sometimes it was burnt; sometimes dry; sometimes uncooked.
CG,Well; it was very nice; the service was very fast and the prices are reasonable; I recommend delicious food.
CG,I wanted a four-cheese ravioli. It's just that the sauce is nice. Unfortunately; it failed. All of the portions have adapted to the economy; they have shrunk.
OR,My guest and I went for dessert;  we waited 10 minutes to get a menu; we placed orders; and we waited another 20 minutes. Of course; one person couldn't make it to the dozens of tables upstairs to work.
CG,It may be the most friendly service I have ever encountered in my life.  All the employees were very sweet; caring people. the drinks and food were very tasty and fresh. I will definitely come again.
OR,Something strange came out of the ice cream; the teas are stale and boiled; and you have to say an order two or three times; I definitely don't recommend it; it's a pity for your money.
CG,The address of quality. The service should be a little faster.

Plus the atmosphere of the place is relaxing; staff nice and friendly and prices pretty moderate. Perfect spot to eat out with friends in the center of Istanbul. Would love to come back again!
CG,Although far easts foods suits my taste; Tom Yum soup was very aromatic and different; I didn't like it.
CG,The waiters took care of me. That's why I left the restaurant before I could order.

CG,The staff is very nice. The food is quite delicious.
CG,"The environment is nice, the food is delicious, the employees are polite. We ate meatballs in İnegöl. the manti were great."

CG,Famous and delicious meatballs.
CG,The food is delicious; but we waited 1 hour after ordering and we were extremely hungry.
CG,I ate Hünkar Begendi and cherry pudding. Both were legends. The meat of Hünkar Begendi was tender.
OR,It has been wonderfully designed in its new location in Karaköy. It's gorgeous inside. Soundproofing I guess. The waiters are very interested and approaching with a smile. The appetizers and great service were very successful. Thanks.
CG,A classy place in Karaköy with its white cloth and good service. Liver lovers should definitely try the liver pan.
CG,The location is nice; the menus are varied; the appetizers are delicious; the prices are a little high.
CG,Excellent appetizers; great atmosphere; acceptable prices.
CG,The place was too noisy. We didn't really enjoy the food in this mess.

CG,Awesome place!
OR,"I can't say anything negative about the place, the ambiance; the staff; the richness of the food; the appetizers; the taste and the presentation; it's just perfect.. But I'm giving 3 points because it's a very expensive place."
CG,We were not satisfied with the service at all. I ordered wine and it came with a little bit of wine in a regular glass.
CG,Yummy yummy! Delicious!
CG,The treats and the food were really delicious; each of them was not one of those places that would cause you to come to the place and leave unhappy.
CG,We came up with the suggestion; everything was very nice.Especially Koksal; who was in the safe; was so interested. Thank you so much for everything.
CG,Although it is not as much as an urfa; it is the only place that can eat liver under samsun conditions. Appetizers can be improved. There should definitely be green mint next to the liver; arugula does not suit the liver.
OR,The parking area is large; valet service is offered. The welcome at the entrance is good. Attention should be paid to order and cleanliness.
CG,The employees are friendly. The prices are also very reasonable according to the food provided. I can call it the first choice in Samsun.
CG,The place is quite big; the employees are interested and friendly; this is 2.development 5 skewers and buttermilk cost 105 tl I liked the price as appropriate.
CG,Its breakfast is really very good. I would like to especially point out that you do not need to go to Cakalli for Menemen; you can eat the most delicious here. I really like the fried egg too.

CG,The food wasn't bad; we got tired of constantly asking for lavash bread; the liver; until the bread came to the table it became like ice.

OR,We went to Iftar; especially they praised the appetizers and treats very much; but as can be seen from the photo; it's not good at all. It was an incredible crowd.

CG,The place is nice; the employees are good. The food is delicious but the human pilfering for extra charge caused me to give it 1 point.

CG,The prices were in the 120-140 range. I didn't like Lahmacun. The appetizers were nice.
CG,Every time I go; the prices change; I don't like it. But even for the treats; you can go; which comes as many appetizers; tea; etc. as you want.
OR,We went for dinner. after 10 minutes; they said do you want meatball; we bought 1 piece; we asked for an account of 32TL; then they reflected it to the account; they put water in the glasses unannounced; they wrote 20TL to the 1.5 liter water on the table. They're not supposed to do it this way.
CG,The sauces and uncooked meats of the dishes give the impression of a meal prepared in the mall and not in a kebab restaurant.
CG,Very; very expensive extravagant prices. One lahmacun is 85 TL. They charge 25 TL for a glass of buttermilk. All the intertwined tables are almost adjacent.
CG,I ate closed doner pita pita were very tasty. Iskender was beautiful. There is a playground for children. Great on treats.

OR,Gaziantep was one of the cities we visited during our trip to Southeast Anatolia. We decided to eat baklava from Kocak Baklava. It is the number ten place for me with its understanding of both quality and service. When I come to Gaziantep again; I want to stop by here again and eat this baklava again.
CG,The waiters were extremely indifferent. We asked for peanuts to taste and they added it to the account. However; the head office was very good.

OR,The hamburger patty is very small; but it is very tasty and different with its unique sauce and bread. It was not pleasant that there were no potatoes in the menu.
CG,The hamburger patties and sauce were very good. I think their mayonnaise is fabricated mayonnaise; It would be tastier if they made it themselves.
CG,Really delicious burgers. The ketchup sauce they make is excellent. The point I want to criticize is the low grammage of the hamburger.
CG,Really delicious burger. I would recommend it to everyone. Thanks to the smiling staff.
CG,The taste of hamburgers is not as good as exaggerated. It's also an expensive restaurant.
CG,The popular boutique burger restaurant of the street. bread; sauce and meatballs are very nice. Thank you.
OR,We tried the Rib Burger and the Cheese Burger. They put cheddar cheese in the burger instead of cheddar. This idea seemed a little different to me. The sauce inside the ribs is a little sweet. It's a different flavor.
CG,Burgers and fries were delicious. Burger meat came well cooked; I suggest you eat it medium cooked. The sauces are quite different and nice; you should definitely try it.
CG,Too expensive; I can cook better. Also; ambiance of the restaurant is old.
CG,Prices are reasonable; chickens are delicious; but what is on the menu is not real. They do not serve the same food as the menu.
CG,My order was missing sauce; missing desert; missing onion rings; fries were cold and stale; fried legs were stale. What a disgrace!
CG,They got my order wrong and got into an argument with me. You are disgusting! Terrible service; mismanagement.
CG,Food should have been better cooked I think overall not bad.
CG,Everything is delicious; there is a lot and at a good price. Service was nice.
CG,The taste is not bad in general; but you can eat better ones in other restaurants.
OR,No management; food is cold and bad quality; no ice in coke. Not happy at all. I recommend either change the airport manager or close that branch. Definitely bad service.
CG,Classical chicken; not awesome taste but it is ok.
CG,The manners of the employees were bad; They didn't even care about me. Bread was stale.
CG,I couldn't finish my meal .Bad smell and bad taste. It seems that the chicken is spoiled. I don't know what to say; but you should not eat in this place. I feel bad because I decided to eat from them.
CG,Delicious and reasonably priced!
CG,The waiters are polite and very interested. The place consists of two concepts; you can eat standing or sitting. The flavors were perfect.
CG,Pasta was fresh. There is always a long queue in front of the place. I ate fettuccine Alfredo; The sauce and flavor were good.
CG,It was served quickly even though it was crowded. It is not a great taste; but it can be preferred for a quick snack.
CG,Great taste.
OR,There are many queues. There is a lack of coordination in the place. Even though you ask for service; they take the bill as soon as the food arrives. Not everyone can eat sitting down; We ate standing.
CG,A delicious masterpiece comes out when it is made in a Parmesan wheel; made with fresh pasta dough by hand; and with its beautiful sauces. The price is also quite reasonable.
CG,Personally; it's very nice Pasta is made; I tried most of the sauces; they were all very good.
OR,It's a very sweet place. Thanks to social media; I learned from there and came. Pasta wasn't bad. In terms of taste; I think it is no different from normal pasta with sauce. The employees are very kind. Order speed is very good. Also; prices are affordable.
CG,There are two parts that you can eat standing or sitting; I'm sure it will be much more enjoyable if you eat sitting down. It is served pretty fast. Prices are reasonable compared to peers.
CG,Incredibly delicious and fresh; fast service and use of environmentally friendly materials..
CG,Pasta is made there; orders are taken and served. All of them are prepared in one place in 20-25 minutes. The taste is good; the service is good and hygienic; I think it is a taste and culture that should be visited and tasted.
OR,We went for dessert; but there are also food and breakfast options. It's not a huge venue and it gets pretty busy. We ate moblan; ibiza; strawberry puff pastry desserts. Moblan comes in huge portions. Desserts are very tasty and fresh.
CG,Kukis is a great business that is both a bakery and a patisserie. Their cakes and tea are outstanding.
CG,Reasonable prices and amazing deserts.
CG,The cake was amazing. I recommend it. For those who want to sit and eat there; a big queue is waiting for you.
OR,Their products are delicious and the sizes are nice. It is very difficult to take orders from the waiters because it is crowded. In addition; the prices should have been more affordable.
CG,Service is fast. Pistachio prince dessert is excellent!
CG,The portion of toast was small; never satiated. Desserts were good.
CG,Great tastes; the interest of the employees was very good; thank you to them.
CG,If you want to eat cake or dessert; the real taste is here. The place is very stylish in design. Each of the employees is very caring and helpful; but they have difficulty dealing with everyone because it is crowded.
CG,Desserts are good but waiters are very surly; We were not well received.
OR,You should not drink coffee; it tasted very bad. I felt like I was drinking earth. Other than that things are nice.
CG,Great venue great food appetizers. I can be a customer from now on.
CG,The meals are very good. Especially plevlevisca; soka and dried meat are very successful.
CG,I did not like the interior atmosphere; seems a little old to me.
CG,The place is quite intimate and the ambiance is very pleasant. Simplicity prevails rather than exaggeration and ostentatiousness.
CG,I recommend you try the dried meat. But their beers were a bit expensive.
CG,Expensive place.
CG,All meals were successful; I recommend.
CG,Lipa is a real old style tavern. There is a warm friendly atmosphere. Dry meat was very good.
CG,Great and chill place; ambiance was nice too.
CG,The atmosphere of the place is very good; the bulgur pilaf with dried meat was very good; the quality of the dried meat is a little low.
CG,The variety is less. Rice and dry meat are very good. The ravioli was not good.
OR,Beautiful; cute; stylish and delicious food. It's a bit sad that it is used more like a restaurant than a book cafe; as it turns into a restaurant at a certain time of the evening; so they took us to a place in the back.
CG,A nice place to drink coffee while reading a book. My meat dish arrived cold first. When I reported this to the waiter; they warmed it up and brought it; and then the meat was dry. I did not see the interest that I expected.
CG,A very well designed cafe; The library looks very stylish. The menu is as you can see in the photo.
CG,Nice and fresh ambiance.
CG,Flat white is very tasty and affordable. The interior of the place is very nicely decorated; I was like amazed.
OR,Interior and location are nice; but not as nice as other restaurant of the same company. We bought a strawberry brownie cake; my friend and I both had a bad stomach.
CG,I tried coffee and a desert; all of them was not bad.
CG,We went a few times for breakfast; we were quite satisfied. The place is really nicely decorated. Breakfast for two was understated and good. The service was smooth and the waiters were kind.
OR,We preferred milkshake and smoothie. Chocolate sauce added to the blueberry milkshake. The smoothie is also unrelated to the smoothie; it was quite sour; so it was not fresh.
CG,A cafe where books and coffee are combined very well.
CG,Ambience is very nice but they don't let you work at the outside tables; that is a negative point.
CG,The place is not very big; but there are enough tables outside as well; but we sat inside. The souffles from the name of the place were very nice.
OR,This café was highly recommended by an Istanbul-based blogger for its soufflés. The unique 2D interiors and decorations caught my eye as soon as I entered. I opted for the Chocolate with Orange soufflé; while my husband chose the Chocolate with Blueberries. I must say; the taste was absolutely amazing.
CG,This is one of my favorite cafes in Istanbul. As you can see on the menu; the soufflés are about 100 TL; the drinks could be more appropriate.
CG,I can say that the lack of lactose-free milk is a big deficiency for me. Desserts were good.
CG,Tasty; delicious soufflés!
OR,There was a queue and the cafe was small. So you have to be willing to wait in line. But it was still a good experience for us. The soufflé was very sugary and after eating a little bit of mister. The gifts given were also very sweet and took us back to our childhood.
CG,It's a very small and elegant place; its decor attracted me as I passed by. This cafe specializes in souffles of various flavors and the service they have is excellent and the staff are welcoming and cheerful.
CG,Overrated souffles. It wasn't as nice as I expected.
CG,I ordered the banana & white chocolate souffle. It was a little small but very tasty. They serve it with ice cream. The staff is also very polite and smiling.
CG,It was worth getting up and going from Beylikduzu. Atmosphere 10/10
CG,This is one of the best sufles I’ve ever eaten. Although it was package service; I like the presentation; taste and texture of the chocolate. Thank you Suflor Team! 
OR,As a doner lover; it met my expectations in terms of price; taste and service. It is sure to increase the flavor in wood fire.
CG,Service was bad. I think a few treats should be given.
CG,High aroma. It is cooked completely on wood fire and without gas fueling. It turns very well.
CG,Great doner; I liked it. Portions of it was enough too.
CG,Seriously cheap and affordable price for those who want to eat delicious meat doner kebab.
CG,Doner was overcooked so it was dry. We ordered ayran; it came late.
OR,Price performance was satisfactory. Although it was wood fired it could have been better. Maybe doner can be asked to be a little more cooked.
CG,The hygiene of the place was not very good.
CG,Ambiance of the place is old and neglected. Doner was ok.
CG,Its wood-fired doner kebab tastes different; it's one of the best doner meats in this area; and it's affordable; too. Congratulations to the business. I will visit once again.
CG,The meat is DELICIOUS; the price is reasonable; but the service is poor.
CG,Definitely do not go without a reservation; it was overcrowded. We ate very delicious pizzas; but waiting in line for 1 hour didn't make any sense.
OR,I don't understand why people wait so long to eat an average pizza.
CG,The dough and zucchini of the pizza were very well cooked. The place was a little noisy.
CG,You can definitely eat the best pizza in Istanbul here. The location is very nice. A good place both in terms of variety and taste. But the prices are quite high; Be careful.
CG,Best pizza in the area; very crowded in weekends.
CG,The quality of the pizzas was worse than before. They made me wait for a while even though the tables were empty.
CG,There are so many types of pizza; you are surprised which one you want to taste. I found it very successful in terms of taste. Atmosphere and service was good.
CG,I tried the smoked ribeye pizza; the dough is thin and very tasty.
CG,Crowded and expensive place.
OR,No bad. It was very crowded; there was no lighting outside; so we could look at the menu with phone flashlights.
CG,Excellent pizza and fine wine. Both food and beverage portions are large. I recommend.
